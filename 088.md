# We cannot donate to the tranche that was removed due to processing bad debt.

## Summary
When `bad debt` occurs, we allocate it to the most junior `tranche`. 
Additionally, we have a function to manually donate to a specific tranche to provide compensation. 
However, if the tranche has been removed from the pool, it is not possible to make a donation.
## Vulnerability Detail
- If the `auction` does not complete within the `cutoff` time, manual `liquidation` should be initiated.
```solidity
function _settleAuction(address account, AuctionInformation storage auctionInformation_) internal returns (bool success) {
    ILendingPool(creditor).settleLiquidationUnhappyFlow(account, startDebt, minimumMargin, msg.sender);
    // All remaining assets are transferred to the asset recipient,
    // and a manual (trusted) liquidation has to be done.
    IAccount(account).auctionBoughtIn(creditorToAccountRecipient[creditor]);
}
```
- The incurred `bad debt` is allocated to the most junior `tranche`.
  If the most junior `tranche` lacks sufficient liquidity, it is removed.
```solidity
function _processDefault(uint256 badDebt) internal {
    for (uint256 i = length; i > 0;) {
        unchecked {
            --i;
        }
        if (badDebt < maxBurnable) {
        } else {
            realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] = 0;
            _popTranche(i, tranche);   // @audit, -> tranche is removed
            unchecked {
                badDebt -= maxBurnable;
            }
            ITranche(tranche).lock();
            // Hook to the new most junior Tranche to inform that auctions are ongoing.
            if (i != 0) ITranche(tranches[i - 1]).setAuctionInProgress(true);
        } 
    }
}
```
- Manual donation to this `tranche` is impossible because it has already been removed from the `tranches` array.
```solidity
function donateToTranche(uint256 trancheIndex, uint256 assets) external whenDepositNotPaused processInterests {
    if (assets == 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.ZeroAmount();
    address tranche = tranches[trancheIndex];
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
}
```
As indicated in the comment for this function, it is used to compensate the junior `tranche` that was affected by a manual auction.
```solidity
* @dev Can be used by anyone to donate assets to the Lending Pool.
 * It is supposed to serve as a way to compensate the jrTranche after an
 * auction didn't get sold and was manually liquidated after cutoffTime.
```
Since the liquidity of the removed `tranche` is `0`, `LPs` receive no redemption through this `tranche`, even if the owner unlocks it.

Of course, the owner of the `pool` can re-add this `tranche` to facilitate `donation`. 
However, this introduces an additional step and adds complexity, especially if they had already decided not to include this `tranche` in the `pool` anymore.
## Impact
When this occurs, the `LPs` who utilized this `tranche` will lose their funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than donating solely to `tranches`, we can donate to normal addresses. 
Alternatively, we can verify whether the address corresponds to the `tranche` address associated with this `pool` as a `LENDING_POOL`.
