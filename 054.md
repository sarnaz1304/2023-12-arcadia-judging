# User can prevent getting liquidated

## Summary
User or anyone can make an account not liquidatable 

## Vulnerability Detail
If user or anyone call `liquidateAccount()` from Liquidator.sol on an account, that account is  flagged as `inAuction == true` at [line 208](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/Liquidator.sol#L208)

At this stage there is still a possibility that the function reverts if the account is solvent. In this case, the `auctionInformatiom_.inAuction` flag is not updated. Thus, after this reverting any future attempt to `liquidateAccount` that account will revert because it's `auctionInformation_.inAuction = true`

## Impact
User can indefinitely prevent liquidation of his account if no one finds out

## Code Snippet


```solidity
    function liquidateAccount(address account) external nonReentrant {
        ...

        // Check if the account is already being auctioned.
        if (auctionInformation_.inAuction) revert LiquidatorErrors.AuctionOngoing();


        // Set the inAuction flag to true.
        auctionInformation_.inAuction = true;

        ...

        // Check if the Account is insolvent and if it is, start the liquidation in the Account.
        // startLiquidation will revert if the Account is still solvent.
        (
            address[] memory assetAddresses,
            uint256[] memory assetIds,
            uint256[] memory assetAmounts,
            address creditor,
            uint96 minimumMargin,
            uint256 debt,
            AssetValueAndRiskFactors[] memory assetValues
        ) = IAccount(account).startLiquidation(msg.sender);

        // Store the Account information.
        auctionInformation_.assetAddresses = assetAddresses;
        auctionInformation_.assetIds = assetIds;
        auctionInformation_.assetAmounts = assetAmounts;
        auctionInformation_.creditor = creditor;
        auctionInformation_.minimumMargin = minimumMargin;
        auctionInformation_.startDebt = uint128(debt);

        // Store the relative value of each asset (the "assetShare"), with respect to the total value of the Account.
        // These will be used to calculate the price of bids to partially liquidate the Account.
        auctionInformation_.assetShares = _getAssetShares(assetValues);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before reverting if the account is solvent, set `auctionInformation_.inAuction` for that account back to `false`
