# The calculation of collateral value should exclude the minimum margin.

## Summary
The `account` must maintain a minimum `margin` for leveraged trading.
However, this `margin` is impacting the calculation of `collateral value`.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario where the minimum `margin` is `1000 USDS` and the `collateral factor` is `0.9`. 
If the `account` holds `2000 USDS`, its `collateral value` would be `1800 USDS`.
```solidity
function getCollateralValue() public view returns (uint256 collateralValue) {
    (address[] memory assetAddresses, uint256[] memory assetIds, uint256[] memory assetAmounts) = generateAssetData();
    collateralValue = IRegistry(registry).getCollateralValue(numeraire, creditor, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);
}
```
If the `account` borrows `850 USDS` from the `creditor`, it will become `unhealthy` and revert.
```solidity
function increaseOpenPosition(uint256 openPosition) {
    if (openPosition > 0 && getCollateralValue() < openPosition + minimumMargin) {  // @audit, -> 1800 < 850 + 1000
        revert AccountErrors.AccountUnhealthy();
    }
}
```

However, it's obvious that the `account` can borrow up to `900 USDS`. 
Among the `2000 USDS`, `1000 USDS` is reserved as the minimum `margin`, leaving `1000 USDS` available for use as `collateral`.

This is because the `margin` is included in the calculation of `collateral value`.

When the minimum `margin` is large and the `collateral factor` is relatively small, this affects the user's expectations regarding leveraged funding.
## Impact
The `account` can borrow amounts less than the available value.

## Recommendation
We can exclude the minimum `margin` from the calculation of `collateral value`.
