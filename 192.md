# Replay can be executed with Excess Amount during Multicall

## Summary
Replay can be executed with Excess Amount during Multicall in the Multicall.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function executeRepay(address creditor, address asset, address account, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount < 1) amount = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));

        (bool success, bytes memory data) =
            creditor.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("repay(uint256,address)", amount, account));
        require(success, string(data));
    }
```
A careful look at the executeRepay(...) function above shows that when input amount is less than 1 i.e 0, amount is assigned the overall asset balance of the contract. This gives an idea of the limit of amount that can be used to call the executeRepay(...) function, the problem is that when amount is not zero no confirm action was done to ensure that the amount called by creditor does not go beyond the allowed threshold which means amount above the max limit can actually be used and taken advantage of
## Impact
Replay can be executed with Excess Amount beyond asset balance during Multicall in the Multicall.sol contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As adjusted in the code below, necessary validation should be done to ensure amount done go beyond the expected limit. 
```solidity
function executeRepay(address creditor, address asset, address account, uint256 amount) external {
        if (amount < 1) amount = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this));
+++ require ( amount <= IERC20(asset).balanceOf(address(this)) , "invalid amount") 
        (bool success, bytes memory data) =
            creditor.call(abi.encodeWithSignature("repay(uint256,address)", amount, account));
        require(success, string(data));
    }
```
