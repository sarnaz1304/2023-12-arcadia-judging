# Directly adding minimumMargin to openPosition might be problematic


## Summary
Minimum margin serves as liquidation rewards buffer but external integrator might have that in USDC or ETH & their lending pool might be of some other token
## Vulnerability Detail

Liquidation Rewards only make sense in ETH or USD but there might be different kinds of lending pool such as COMP etc, these other assets cant serve as a good margin as its value can drop drastically, which can make **terminating liquidations unprofitable**. There are also no checks in the AccountV1.sol that make sure minimum margin is denominated in the same token as numeraire token.

So this can lead to a footgun for external integrators of Accounts.
```solidity
    function increaseOpenPosition(uint256 openPosition)
        external
        onlyCreditor
        nonReentrant
        notDuringAuction
        updateActionTimestamp
        returns (uint256 accountVersion)
    {
        // If the open position is 0, the Account is always healthy.
        // An Account is unhealthy if the collateral value is smaller than the used margin.
        // The used margin equals the sum of the given open position and the minimum margin.
        if (openPosition > 0 && getCollateralValue() < openPosition + minimumMargin) { ///@audit openPos & minMargin can be different tokens
            revert AccountErrors.AccountUnhealthy();
        }

        accountVersion = ACCOUNT_VERSION;
    }
```

Example -
Company xyz integrates with accounts with their own creditPool but they do not want to set volatile token 'yz' as minimumMargin, so they set value in USDC, in lending pool of token 'yz' but increaseOpenPosition directly adds 'yz' + USDc denominated minMargin

## Impact
Can lead to wrong calculation of whether a account is healthy or not.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Always set minimumMargin value in USD tokens or in ETH as other lending protocols do, then in increaseOpenPosition convert minMargin to numeraire. To make sure liquidationReward is always a better incentive than to DOS the juniorTranche
