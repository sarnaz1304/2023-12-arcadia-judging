# USDbC (Bridged USDC on Base) may cause insolvency in the protocol if it deppegs from USDC

## Summary

Failure to use a correct oracle address can cause unexpected pricing behavior in the USDbC pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lack of a Chainlink Price Feed for USDbC and the decision to use the USDC Price Feed for the token, in the case of a depeg of the bridged token from USDC, users will be able to arbitrage with other protocols taking debt at a non-real price.

## Impact

This potential depeg, as the protocol won't be able to handle it, may cause a drain of the tokens from the pool.

## Code Snippet

As written in `accounts-v2/test/fork/asset-modules/stargate/USDbCPool.fork.t.sol` line 38-40:

It is clear that the intentions are to use USDC oracle for USDbC.
