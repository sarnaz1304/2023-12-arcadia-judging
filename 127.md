# Tranche gets unfair share of interests regardless of its liquidity

## Summary
A tranche gets an unfair share of interest collected based on weights even if it has minimal liquidity

## Vulnerability Detail
When processing interests tranches get allocated their share of interest based on the `interestWeightTranches` for each tranche in the [`_syncInterestsToLiquidityProviders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/de7289bebb3729505a2462aa044b3960d8926d78/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L746)

This function has a check to make sure that `realisedLiquidity` of a tranche is non-zero. But does not have any check to make sure that the tranche has sufficient liquidity to justify the allocation of interest share. 
```solidity
                realisedLiquidity = realisedLiquidityOf[tranches[i]];
                // Don't pay interests to Tranches without liquidity.
                // Interests will go to treasury instead.
                if (realisedLiquidity == 0) continue;
                trancheShare = assets.mulDivDown(interestWeightTranches[i], totalInterestWeight_);
```
In that case tranche can have minimum liquidity above 1 wei into the lending pool and gain an unfair share of the interests based on this formula:
```solidity
               trancheShare = assets.mulDivDown(interestWeightTranches[i], totalInterestWeight_);
```


## Impact
Unfair share of interests goes to a tranche with minimal liquidity.

## Recommendation
Considering allocating the interest based on the liquidity share of a tranche or ad a minimum liquidity check to justify the interest share allocation based on the weights.
