# M-1: Liquidation Reverts Due to Zero Debt Token Mint

## Summary
The lending pool liquidation process, where the minting of zero debt tokens during a borrow operation can cause the liquidation to revert erroneously.

## Vulnerability Detail
A vulnerability exists in the lending pool's borrow function, which indirectly leads to the liquidation process reverting due to the minting of zero debt tokens. This occurs when the `LendingPool.sol::borrow` function calls the `DebtToken.sol::_deposit`,which in turn calls the `previewDeposit` function defined in `ERC4626.sol`. The `previewDeposit`function uses `convertToShare` to determine the number of shares (debt tokens) to mint for the borrowed amount. However, due to the rounding down behavior of `convertToShares`, a small borrowed amount can result in zero shares being minted.

## Impact

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L872

When a borrower with a small debt amount attempts to initiate liquidation, the `LendingPool.sol::startLiquidation` function checks the borrower's debt using `maxWithdraw`, which relies on the number of debt tokens they hold. If the borrower received zero debt tokens due to the rounding down issue, `maxWithdraw `will return zero, indicating no debt. As a result, the `LendingPool.sol::startLiquidation`function reverts:
```javascript
        if (startDebt == 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.IsNotAnAccountWithDebt();
```
 even though the borrower has an outstanding debt. This prevents the liquidation process from proceeding and leaves the debt unresolved, potentially leading to bad debt in the lending pool.

## Code Snippet
```javascript
      function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply; // Total supply of shares in the pool.
    
    // If there are no shares, return the asset amount directly.
    // Otherwise, calculate the number of shares by rounding down the division.
    //@audit-> This can result in zero shares
    return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply, totalAssets());
}
```
## POC
A borrower takes out a small loan from the lending pool, triggering the borrow function.
The borrow function calls `_deposit` to mint debt tokens corresponding to the borrowed amount.
`_deposit` calls `previewDeposit` from `ERC4626.sol`, which uses `convertToShares` to calculate the number of shares to mint.
Due to the small loan amount and rounding down in `convertToShares`, the borrower receives zero debt tokens.
The borrower later becomes undercollateralized and attempts to initiate liquidation by calling `startLiquidation`.
`startLiquidation` calls `maxWithdraw`, which returns zero since the borrower has zero debt tokens.
The liquidation process reverts with LendingPoolErrors.IsNotAnAccountWithDebt, as it incorrectly assumes the borrower has no debt.
The lending pool is left with an unresolved debt, as the liquidation cannot proceed.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Implement a minimum borrow amount that ensures at least one debt token is minted.
Use a `mulDivUp` function instead of `mulDivDown` in `convertToShares` to round up the number of shares.
