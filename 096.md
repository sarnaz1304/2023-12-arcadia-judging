# No slippage checks for withdraw or deposit on Tranche.sol.

## Summary
In an event where the asset/share ratio changes drastically user may not get the desired amount of shares or assets during deposit or withdraw. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a below scenario which is highly possible after a liquidation is settled or there is a donation of large amount of assets to the Tranche via donateToTranche(uint256 trancheIndex, uint256 assets) function:
- Alice decides to withdraw her assets from the Tranche and submits a transaction, expecting to redeem her shares for an equivalent value of the underlying asset at current market prices. 
- Meanwhile, the market experiences significant volatility, and a large sell order for the underlying asset or liquidation event causes its price to plummet. The Tranche.sol contract lacks a slippage check mechanism for the withdraw function, failing to adjust the withdrawal amount based on real-time asset prices.
-  When Alice's transaction is processed, the absence of a slippage check means she receives far less than expected, resulting in a substantial financial loss. 

## Impact

Loss of user(EOA's mostly impacted) funds that are trying to withdraw from middle Tranches considering junior Tranches are locked during auctions.

## Recommendation
A minAssetOut/minSharesOut check can be used in withdraw/deposit or using a [wrapper ](https://github.com/ERC4626-Alliance/ERC4626-Contracts#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router])as recommended by OZ.
