# Donation may be added to zero address.

## Summary
`LendingPool.sol#donateToTranche` function does not check if `trancheIndex` is valid.
So the donation assets may be added to zero address but not to the intended tranche.

## Vulnerability Detail
`LendingPool.sol#donateToTranche` function is the following.
```solidity
    function donateToTranche(uint256 trancheIndex, uint256 assets) external whenDepositNotPaused processInterests {
        if (assets == 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.ZeroAmount();

353:    address tranche = tranches[trancheIndex];

        // Need to transfer before donating or ERC777s could reenter.
        // Address(this) is trusted -> no risk on re-entrancy attack after transfer.
        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        unchecked {
360:        realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] += assets; //[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅]
            totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(assets + totalRealisedLiquidity);
        }
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function does not check if `trancheIndex` is valid.
If `trancheIndex >= tranches.length`, the `tranche = address(0)` holds in `L353`. 
So the donated assets may be added to zero address but not to the intended tranche in `L360`.

Example:
1. Administrator tries to donate assets to the junior tranche by calling `donateToTranche` function.
2. While the admin's tx stays in the mempool, the junior tranche is popped by unhappy liquidation flow.
3. The donation assets are added to zero address.

## Impact
Donation process may function with error and the donation assets will not be added to intended tranches.
There is no way of withdrawing these assets from the contract.

## Recommendation
Modify the `LendingPool.sol#donateToTranche` function as follows.
```solidity
    function donateToTranche(uint256 trancheIndex, uint256 assets) external whenDepositNotPaused processInterests {
        if (assets == 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.ZeroAmount();
++      if (trancheIndex >= tranches.length) revert LendingPoolErrors.NonExistingTranche();

        address tranche = tranches[trancheIndex];

        // Need to transfer before donating or ERC777s could reenter.
        // Address(this) is trusted -> no risk on re-entrancy attack after transfer.
        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

        unchecked {
            realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] += assets; //[̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅]
            totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(assets + totalRealisedLiquidity);
        }
    }
```
