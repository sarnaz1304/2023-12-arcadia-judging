# error is not properly handled for a user who create `Proxy` using `Factory` with the same salt twice.

## Summary
The used `salt` from a certain user to call `createAccount` in order to create `Proxy` is not stored nor flagged, and there is no proper error handling for this. Thus if the user tries to `createAccount` with the same `salt` multiple times, an unexpected revert will happen and the user will have no idea of what happened.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function [Factory::createAccount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Factory.sol#L84-L111), the `salt` is used to create `Proxy`.

```solidity
        account = address(
            new Proxy{ salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(salt, tx.origin)) }(
                versionInformation[accountVersion].implementation
            )
        );
```

However, the `salt` is not stored nor flagged for the current user. So it's possible that the user may call `Factory::createAccount` twice. 

The contract doesn't properly handle this issue. So when the same user uses a `salt` twice, an expected revert would occur without a specific reason being given.

The POC is below:

```solidity
    function test_doubleDeploy() public {
        address proxyAddress = factory.createAccount(0, 0, address(0));
        console2.log("proxyAddress ", proxyAddress);
        vm.expectRevert();
        address proxyAddress2 = factory.createAccount(0, 0, address(0));
    }
```

and the output is simply reverted with no specific reason being given.

## Impact

When the user uses the `salt` twice, the transaction would unexpectedly revert with no specific reason being given as this kind of scenario is never properly handled.

## Code Snippet
[Factory::createAccount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Factory.sol#L84-L111)
```solidity
    function createAccount(uint256 salt, uint256 accountVersion, address creditor)
        external
        whenCreateNotPaused
        returns (address account)
    {
        accountVersion = accountVersion == 0 ? latestAccountVersion : accountVersion;

        if (accountVersion > latestAccountVersion) revert FactoryErrors.InvalidAccountVersion();
        if (accountVersionBlocked[accountVersion]) revert FactoryErrors.AccountVersionBlocked();
        

        // Hash tx.origin with the user-provided salt to avoid front-running Account deployment with an identical salt.
        // We use tx.origin instead of msg.sender so that deployments through a third party contract are not vulnerable to front-running.
        account = address(
            new Proxy{ salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(salt, tx.origin)) }(
                versionInformation[accountVersion].implementation
            )
        );
        ...
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

1. Use a mapping to store if `tx.origin + salt` has been used.

2. use `try-catch` to handle this case, and revert when necessary.
```solidity
        try  new Proxy{ salt: keccak256(abi.encodePacked(salt, tx.origin)) }(
                   versionInformation[accountVersion].implementation
                )
        returns (Proxy account) {
            return address(account);
        }
        catch (bytes memory reason){
            revert("Used Salt");
        }
```
