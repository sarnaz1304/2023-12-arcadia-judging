# If there's dust amount left within a tranche, it might cause next depositor to lose their money

## Summary
If there's dust amount left within a tranche, it might cause next depositor to lose their money

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever there's bad debt created, it reduces the share value of the most junior tranche. In certain cases, it may just happen that all shares are worth only a dust amount. (e.g. 1e18 shares are worth a total of 10 wei)

```solidity
   function convertToSharesAndSync(uint256 assets) public returns (uint256 shares) {
        // Cache totalSupply.
        uint256 supply = totalSupply;

        shares = supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply + VAS, totalAssetsAndSync() + VAS);
    }
```
However, when calculating the shares to be minted, there's virtual reserves to be accounted for. They are usually used to prevent from inflation attacks, but in this case, they would cause us another error. For reference we will use usual values for a token with 18 decimals - 1000 VAS

The actual share/asset ratio should be `1e18` : 10, but because of the virtual reserves, the newly minted shares will be calculated at share/asset ratio of roughly `1e18 : 1000`, resulting in the user getting 100x shares than expected, or occurring a loss of ~99%. 99% of their funds will actually go towards other liquidity providers in a sort of a donation.

## Recommendation
If the tranche has minted shares, only allow deposits if the `totalAssets` are above a certain threshold (e.g. 1e8)
