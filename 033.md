# Some NFT can be both ERC721 and ERC1155, which is not considered by the design

## Summary
Some NFT is meant to support both ERC721 and ERC1155 (for example, see [Asset Token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fbf5c9af42a6d146dcc18762f515692cd5f853b#code)).   But this case is not considered in the contract. If a token of this kind is added firstly by `ERC721`-typed `AssetModule`, it can not be supported by `ERC1155`-typed `AssetModule`, and its transfer will be greatly limited since an amount larger than 1 will cause revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the [AbstractAM::constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractAM.sol#L68-L71), the `ASSET_TYPE` is fixed and will be later returned in [AbstractAM::processAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractAM.sol#L97-L99)
```solidity
    constructor(address registry_, uint256 assetType_) Owned(msg.sender) {
        REGISTRY = registry_;
        ASSET_TYPE = assetType_;
    }
    ...
    function processAsset(address asset, uint256 assetId) external view virtual returns (bool, uint256) {
        return (isAllowed(asset, assetId), ASSET_TYPE);
    }
```

But for `ERC721`-typed `AssetModule`(including mock files like `FloorERC721AM`), when adding assets, the function `supportsInterface` is never called for the assets.

However, Some NFTs are meant to support both ERC721 and ERC1155 (for example, see [Asset Token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fbf5c9af42a6d146dcc18762f515692cd5f853b#code)). So if a token of this kind is added firstly by `ERC721`-typed `AssetModule`, it can not be supported by `ERC1155`-typed `AssetModule` due to the check in [Registry::addAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L248-L254)

```solidity
    function addAsset(address assetAddress) external onlyAssetModule {
        if (inRegistry[assetAddress]) revert RegistryErrors.AssetAlreadyInRegistry();

        inRegistry[assetAddress] = true;

        emit AssetAdded(assetAddress, assetToAssetModule[assetAddress] = msg.sender);
    }
```

Thus, the NFT's transfer will be greatly limited since `ERC721` only supports transfer by amount `1`.

An example of this can been seen in `AccountV1::_deposit` and `AccountV1::_withdraw`

```solidity
            } else if (assetTypes[i] == 1) {
                if (assetAmounts[i] != 1) revert AccountErrors.InvalidERC721Amount();
                _withdrawERC721(to, assetAddresses[i], assetIds[i]);
            }
```

## Impact
If a token that supports both ERC721 and ERC1155 is added firstly by `ERC721`-typed `AssetModule`, it can not be supported by `ERC1155`-typed `AssetModule` again, and its transfer will be greatly limited since the amount can not exceed 1.

## Recommendation

Consider this kind of situation and perform checks so that if an NFT is meant to support both ERC721 and ERC1155, it could only be added by `ERC1155`-typed `AssetModule`.
