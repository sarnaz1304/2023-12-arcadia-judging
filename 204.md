# Oracle Integrity for Asset Pricing

## Summary
The `Registry` contract's reliance on external oracles for asset pricing introduces a dependency on the integrity and reliability of these data sources. While the contract assumes that the provided data is accurate and tamper-proof, it lacks explicit validation mechanisms to verify the integrity of the data received from oracles.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract does not implement mechanisms to validate or cross-check the prices received from external oracles. This absence of validation increases the risk of using manipulated or incorrect data for critical financial calculations, such as asset valuation, loan issuance, and risk assessment.

## Impact
Reliance on potentially compromised oracle data without adequate validation could lead to significant financial inaccuracies, affecting asset valuations, lending decisions, and overall platform security. Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in the oracle data feed to manipulate market positions or extract undue value from the platform.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement additional checks and balances around oracle data usage, including sanity checks, threshold validations, and possibly incorporating data from multiple independent oracles to mitigate the risk of relying on compromised or erroneous data.
