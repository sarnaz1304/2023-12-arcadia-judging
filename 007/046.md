# Administrator cannot get liquidity of treasury correctly.

## Summary
Administrator can get liquidity of treasury by calling `LendingPool.sol#liquidityOf` function.
In the case of `lastSyncedTimestamp != block.timestamp`, the return value does not contain the unrealised interest.

## Vulnerability Detail
`LendingPool.sol#liquidityOf` function is the following.
```solidity
    function liquidityOf(address owner_) external view returns (uint256 assets) {
        // Avoid a second calculation of unrealised debt (expensive).
        // if interests are already synced this block.
643:    if (lastSyncedTimestamp != uint32(block.timestamp)) {
            // The total liquidity of a tranche equals the sum of the realised liquidity
            // of the tranche, and its pending interests.
646:        uint256 interest = calcUnrealisedDebt().mulDivDown(interestWeight[owner_], totalInterestWeight);
            unchecked {
                assets = realisedLiquidityOf[owner_] + interest;
            }
        } else {
            assets = realisedLiquidityOf[owner_];
        }
    }
```
In the case of `lastSyncedTimestamp != block.timestamp`, the above function calculates the unrealised interest by `interestWeight` state variable.

On the other hand, `LendingPool.sol#setTreasuryWeights` function is the following.
```solidity
    function setTreasuryWeights(uint16 interestWeight_, uint16 liquidationWeight) external onlyOwner processInterests {
        totalInterestWeight = totalInterestWeight - interestWeightTreasury + interestWeight_;

        emit TreasuryWeightsUpdated(
            interestWeightTreasury = interestWeight_, liquidationWeightTreasury = liquidationWeight
        );
    }
```
As can be seen, the above function does not set `interestWeight` state variable and `interestWeight[treasury] = address(0)` always hold.
Thus when `owner_ = treasury` in the `liquidityOf` function, `interest = 0` holds true in `L646`.

In the meantime, administrator also can get liquidity of treasury by calling `LendingPool.sol#liquidityOfAndSync` function, but the function has no view modifier so it does not return before block has been mined and it consumes more gas.

## Impact
Administrator cannot get liquidity of treasury correctly.

## Recommendation
Modify `LendingPool.sol#liquidityOf` function as follows.
```solidity
    function liquidityOf(address owner_) external view returns (uint256 assets) {
        // Avoid a second calculation of unrealised debt (expensive).
        // if interests are already synced this block.
        if (lastSyncedTimestamp != uint32(block.timestamp)) {
            // The total liquidity of a tranche equals the sum of the realised liquidity
            // of the tranche, and its pending interests.
--          uint256 interest = calcUnrealisedDebt().mulDivDown(interestWeight[owner_], totalInterestWeight);
++          uint256 weight = interestWeight[owner_];
++          if (owner_ == treasury) {
++              weight = interestWeightTreasury;
++          }
++          uint256 interest = calcUnrealisedDebt().mulDivDown(weight, totalInterestWeight);
            unchecked {
                assets = realisedLiquidityOf[owner_] + interest;
            }
        } else {
            assets = realisedLiquidityOf[owner_];
        }
    }
```
