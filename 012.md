# Uphappy flow when liquidation not check if the debt owner have any unwithdraw surplus amount stored in the Lending Pool

## Summary
Uphappy flow when liquidation not check if the debt owner's `realisedLiquidityOf[debt's owner]` stored in the Lending Pool. Instead it will decrease staker's vault to payback the debt

## Vulnerability Detail
The variable `mapping(address => uint256) internal realisedLiquidityOf` used to distribute mostly to LendingPool's tranches and treasury. It also ditribute to normal users in these case
	- Reward to initator who startLiquidation()
	- Reward to terminator who is the settle the auction
	- Send surplus amount to the debt owner when terminator overbid in happy flow

After that, normal user can withdraw the asset out using withdrawFromLendingPool().

Note the surplus amount received by debt owner can't be used to deduct the amount of the new debt when that debt owner got liquidated again. When things go wrong, the new debt have go to unhappy flow and have to decrease tranche liquidity to pay back bad debt. Because of that, staker in the junior tranche will lose their profits. 
We can deduct the impact of bad debt here by checking if the debt owner's `realisedLiquidityOf[debt owner]` have any unclaimed assets to pay back the debt.

## Impact
This lead to the protocol staking vault more vurnable to bad debt

## Tool used 
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Step 1: we need to send surplus amount when happy flow to the debt account, not debt owner -> easier for step 2, 3
Step 2: we need to restrict all borrower who have borrow any asset in the LendingPool by DOS withdrawFromLendingPool(). We must only let borrower withdraw when borrower have no debt any that particular LendingPool
Step 3: we need to implement the logic of deducting logic in `_settleLiquidationHappyFlow()` function

Here is my fix, note that this is not tested and not bug-free:
Step 1: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/de7289bebb3729505a2462aa044b3960d8926d78/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L938C1-L966C6

```diff
    function _settleLiquidationHappyFlow(
        address account,
        uint256 startDebt,
        uint256 minimumMargin_,
        address terminator,
        uint256 surplus
    ) internal {
        (uint256 initiationReward, uint256 terminationReward, uint256 liquidationPenalty) =
            _calculateRewards(startDebt, minimumMargin_);

        _syncLiquidationFee(liquidationPenalty);

        totalRealisedLiquidity =
            SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + terminationReward + liquidationPenalty + surplus);

        unchecked {
-           if (surplus > 0) realisedLiquidityOf[IAccount(account).owner()] += surplus;
+           if (surplus > 0) realisedLiquidityOf[account] += surplus;
            realisedLiquidityOf[terminator] += terminationReward;
        }

        _endLiquidation();
    }

```
