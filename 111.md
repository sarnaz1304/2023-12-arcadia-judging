# Unnecessary popping of Tranche in an edge case where badDebt == maxBurnable.

## Summary
The _processDefault function is designed to handle the accounting of bad debt within a lending pool by sequentially writing off the bad debt from the most junior tranche upwards. A vulnerability exists when the badDebt amount equals the maxBurnable amount of the current tranche being processed. In this edge case, the function unnecessarily removes the tranche from the pool, even though the bad debt could have been perfectly offset by the tranche's liquidity without requiring its removal.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises in the loop that iterates over the tranches array in reverse order (from the most junior to the most senior tranche). The loop aims to deduct the badDebt from the realisedLiquidityOf the current tranche. If badDebt is less than maxBurnable (the liquidity of the current tranche), it deducts the badDebt and exits the loop. However, if badDebt equals maxBurnable, the function treats this scenario as if the badDebt exceeds maxBurnable, leading to the tranche's complete wipeout and removal via the _popTranche function, even though the tranche's liquidity perfectly covers the badDebt.

## Impact
Unnecessary freezing of user funds and actions in an edge case.
