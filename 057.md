# A borrower's Account can be liquidated during the paused state of the LendingPool#`repay()` - because of the `whenRepayNotPaused()` modifier

## Summary
Within the LendingPool#`repay()`, the `whenRepayNotPaused()` modifier would be attached. 
Hence, during the paused state of the LendingPool#`repay()` function, a borrower can **not** repay their Account's debt. On the other hand, the interest would still keep being accrued and therefore the borrower's Account can be eligible for a liquidation overtime.

This is problematic because, once the borrower's Account's health factor would drops below the liquidation threshold during the paused state of the LendingPool#`repay()`, the borrower's Account would force to be liquidated by a liquidator (bot)and therefore the borrower would lose their collateral - even if the borrower wanted to repay their debt to avoid that their debt position is liquidated.


## Vulnerability Detail
Within the LendingPool#`repay()`, the `whenRepayNotPaused()` modifier would be attached like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L464
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Repays debt.
     * @param amount The amount of underlying ERC20 tokens to be repaid.
     * @param account The contract address of the Arcadia Account backing the debt.
     * @dev if Account is not an actual address of an Arcadia Account, maxWithdraw(account) will always return 0.
     * Function will not revert, but amount is always 0.
     * @dev Anyone (EOAs and contracts) can repay debt in the name of an Account.
     */
    function repay(uint256 amount, address account) external whenRepayNotPaused processInterests { ///<--------- @audit
        uint256 accountDebt = maxWithdraw(account);
        amount = accountDebt > amount ? amount : accountDebt;

        // Need to transfer before burning debt or ERC777s could reenter.
        // Address(this) is trusted -> no risk on re-entrancy attack after transfer.
        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        _withdraw(amount, address(this), account);
        ...
```

Once the owner of the LendingPool contract would pause the LendingPool#`repay()` function due to any reasons, a borrower can **not** call the LendingPool#`repay()` function to repay their Account's debt until the LendingPool#`repay()` function would be unpaused.

This is problematic. Because, during the paused state of the LendingPool#`repay()` function, the interest would still be accrued and therefore the health factor of the borrower's Account can be below the liquidation threshold overtime. Hence, it can eventually be moved to the liquidatable status.

A liquidator (or a liquidator bot) would monitor whether or not the borrower's Account is moved to the liquidatable status and the liquidator would call the Liquidator#`liquidateAccount()` and then, the liquidator would call the Liquidator#`bid()`.

As a result, the Alice's Account has already been liquidated and their collateral has already been auctioned off during the 
paused state of the LendingPool#`repay()` function. Hence, she (her Account) lost her collateral.


## Exploit scenario (PoC)
**Assumption:**
- Let's say there are 3 actors:
  - Paul is the owner of the LendingPool contract.
  - Alice is a Account Owner (borrower).
  - Bob is a liquidator.

**Exploit scenario:**
- 1/ Paul would pause the LendingPool#`repay()` function - due to some unforeseen circumstances or for maintenance purposes or for upgrading contracts or for fixing a critical bug (that is found by white hacker via a bug bounty or by a malicious attack), etc.

- 2/ During the paused state, Alice wants to repay her Account's debt. However, she is unable to do so - since the LendingPool#`repay()` function would be prohibited to repay her Account's debt.

- 3/ Even though LendingPool#`repay()` function is still paused, the interest would still keep being accrued. So, overtime, her Account would be moved to the eligible status for liquidation.

- 4/ Bob (or a liquidation Bot) would monitor the step 3/ above and he would call the Liquidator#`liquidateAccount()` and then he call the Liquidator#`bid()`.

- 5/ Bob's TX would be executed.
  - Bob would be successful to liquidate the Alice's Account and bid for their auction. So, he receive the liquidation rewards from them. 

- 6/ Paul would unpause the LendingPool#`repay()` function. 

- 7/ Alice is willing to immediately repay her Account's debt by calling the LendingPool#`repay()`. But, her Account has already been liquidated and their collateral has already been auctioned off when the step 5/ above. So, she (her Account) lost her collateral.


## Impact
A borrower's Account would force to be liquidated and therefore the borrower (the borrower's Account) lose their collateral - even if the borrower was willing to repay their Account's debt to avoid that their Account is liquidated.

- Manual Review


## Recommendation
Within the LendingPool#`repay()`, consider removing the `whenRepayNotPaused()` modifier like this:
```diff
+   function repay(uint256 amount, address account) external processInterests {
-   function repay(uint256 amount, address account) external whenRepayNotPaused processInterests {
        uint256 accountDebt = maxWithdraw(account);
        amount = accountDebt > amount ? amount : accountDebt;

        // Need to transfer before burning debt or ERC777s could reenter.
        // Address(this) is trusted -> no risk on re-entrancy attack after transfer.
        asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        _withdraw(amount, address(this), account);
        ...
```
