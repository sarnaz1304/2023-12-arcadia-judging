# Ownership of Accounts can be transferred to zero address making the protocol incurr bad debt

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The ownership of account is transferred from the `Factory` contract which in turn calls the `transferOwnership` in the `Account` contract itself.
First
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2%2Fsrc%2FFactory.sol#L170-L174
```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, address account) public {
        uint256 id = accountIndex[account];
        IAccount(allAccounts[id - 1]).transferOwnership(to);
        super.safeTransferFrom(from, to, id);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2%2Fsrc%2Faccounts%2FAccountV1.sol#L265-L270
Second 
```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyFactory notDuringAuction {
        if (block.timestamp <= lastActionTimestamp + COOL_DOWN_PERIOD) revert AccountErrors.CoolDownPeriodNotPassed();

        // The Factory will check that the new owner is not address(0).
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
There's no call made to the factory before assigning the `newOwner` as the `owner`
## Impact
This will allow users who notices they are going to get liquidate due to movement in price to transfer their account ownership to a zero address, which can't get liquidated there by leaving the system in bad debt.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`transferOwnerShip` should call the internal `_transferOwnerShip` which calls back the `Factory` to check if the`newOwner` is null before setting the `newOwner` 

```solidity

    function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal {
        // The Factory will check that the new owner is not address(0).
        owner = newOwner;
        IFactory(FACTORY).safeTransferAccount(newOwner);
    }
```
