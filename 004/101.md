# Any one can transfer account  ownership of different users Account

## Summary
The `safeTransferFrom` functions allow for the transfer of account ownerships via the factory, the function is can be called by anyone allowing the transfer of `Account` belonging to another user and changing its ownership to the new users . 

The function is stated as public and doesn't check if the owner of the account made the call, an attacker can use this to move accounts around without authorization.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2%2Fsrc%2FFactory.sol#L170-L174
```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, address account) public {
        uint256 id = accountIndex[account];
        IAccount(allAccounts[id - 1]).transferOwnership(to);
        super.safeTransferFrom(from, to, id);
    }
```
When `safeTransferFrom` gets called it call the `transferOwnership` in the `Accoount` contract and the following checks are made 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2%2Fsrc%2Faccounts%2FAccountV1.sol#L265-L270
```solidity
function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyFactory notDuringAuction {
        if (block.timestamp <= lastActionTimestamp + COOL_DOWN_PERIOD) revert AccountErrors.CoolDownPeriodNotPassed();

        // The Factory will check that the new owner is not address(0).
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
First it checks if the call was made from the `Factory` and if `notDuringAuction` and the `COOL_DOWN_PERIOD` then updates the `owner` to the `newOwner`.

## Impact
If an Account is profitable this can be used to steal all the funds in them, the attacker will only need to transfer the account to and addresses they control.
Users will lose access to their account and any funds related to it.
An attacker can simply move account ownership of different accounts to a zero address thereby leading to loss for both the costumer and the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include an access control mechanism to prevent the transfer of accounts from unauthorized parties.
