# Incorrect position ownership check throughout abstract staking asset module

## Summary

Throughout `AbstractStakingAM`, functionality related to the management of staking positions is authenticated by comparing the owner of the relevant position ID with `msg.sender`. However, users will be managing their positions through `AccountV1.flashAction`, so `msg.sender` will actually be `MultiCall`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The functions `increaseLiquidity`, `decreaseLiquidity`, and `claimReward` all require that the calling account owns the position it is attempting to operate on. This would only be the case if the user was calling the staking asset module directly — otherwise, `msg.sender` will be the Action Handler that sits between `AccountV1` and the asset modules it interacts with.

## Impact

While this would prevent most users from interacting with any asset module that inherits `AbstractStakingAM`, it is actually possible to side-step this issue by withdrawing and then depositing the position NFT with every call to any of the above-listed functions (by specifying both actions in `ActionData` structures provided to `flashAction`).

It seems unlikely that this was the intended process for interacting with the staking asset module, however, since each unnecessary transfer adds risk and provides no reward. As such, the severity of this issue is marked as "medium" to reflect that much of the functionality is made unusable in its intended way by this bug, despite the fact that a workaround is possible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If the Arcadia account calling `MultiCall` were to be passed along to the asset module (either as `address(this)` from `AccountV1` or `msg.sender` in `MultiCall`, so it cannot be manipulated), these functions could check that the provided address owns the relevant position without requiring unnecessary transfers (which should be avoided, since these positions can store huge values).

It is worth noting that this would require changes to the accessibility of these functions, since any user could provide an arbitrary address as a parameter and pretend to be the owner of its positions. This would be best handled by requiring that `msg.sender` is an approved `MultiCall`, which could be tracked by the Registry.
