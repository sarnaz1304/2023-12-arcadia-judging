# Account never will be able to update account registry

## Summary
To update an Arcadia Account via the `upgradeAccountVersion()` function in the `Factory.sol` contract, users must follow these steps:
1. **Ensure Ownership**: The caller of `upgradeAccountVersion()` must be the owner of the account to be upgraded. This is enforced by checking if the caller (`msg.sender`) is the owner of the account in question.
2. **Check for Blocked Versions**: The function checks if the specified account version to upgrade to is not blocked. If the version is blocked, the transaction is reverted.
3. **Verify Upgrade Path**: The upgrade path from the current version to the desired version must be verified using a Merkle proof. This proof is passed to the function as an array of bytes32 elements (`bytes32[] calldata proofs`). The function uses `MerkleProofLib.verify()` to ensure the upgrade path is valid. If the verification fails, the transaction is reverted.
4. **Perform the Upgrade**: If the ownership is confirmed, the version is not blocked, and the upgrade path is verified, the account's proxy contract is instructed to upgrade to the new version. This involves setting the new implementation address, registry, and version-specific data for the account.

## Vulnerability Detail
However there is a case where **accounts never will be able to update account registry**. The issue arises when attempting to upgrade an account's registry if the `numeraire` is not set to a value supported by the new registry, leading to an irreversible state where the account cannot update its registry.

The core of the issue lies in the conditional check during the account upgrade process, which reverts the transaction if the new registry does not contain the currently set `numeraire`. This check is intended to ensure that the account's `numeraire` is valid within the context of the new registry. However, it inadvertently creates a catch-22 situation for users attempting to transition to a new registry that does not support their current `numeraire`.

The problematic code snippet is as follows:

```solidity
function upgradeAccount(
    address newImplementation,
    address newRegistry,
    uint256 newVersion,
    bytes calldata data
  ) external onlyFactory nonReentrant notDuringAuction updateActionTimestamp {

  // ... code ...

  if (
    newRegistry != oldRegistry &&
    !IRegistry(newRegistry).inRegistry(numeraire)
  ) {
    revert AccountErrors.InvalidRegistry();
  }

  // ... code ...

}
```

This logic creates a deadlock scenario under the following conditions:
1. An account is initialized with a registry set, but without a `numeraire` set.
2. The user sets a `numeraire` that is supported by the current registry via `AccountV1.sol#setNumeraire()`.
3. The user attempts to update the account registry to a new one that does not support the currently set `numeraire`, resulting in a transaction revert due to the above check.
4. Attempting to preemptively change the `numeraire` to one supported by the intended new registry also fails, as the current registry does not support the new `numeraire`.

## Impact
This issue severely restricts user flexibility in managing their accounts within the Arcadia Protocol, effectively locking them into their current registry settings. This not only impacts user experience but could also have broader implications for the protocol's adaptability and user trust.

## Code Snippet
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Factory.sol#L141-L160
```solidity
    function upgradeAccountVersion(address account, uint256 version, bytes32[] calldata proofs) external {
        if (_ownerOf[accountIndex[account]] != msg.sender) revert FactoryErrors.OnlyAccountOwner();
        if (accountVersionBlocked[version]) revert FactoryErrors.AccountVersionBlocked();

        uint256 currentVersion = IAccount(account).ACCOUNT_VERSION();
        bool canUpgrade =
            MerkleProofLib.verify(proofs, versionRoot, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(currentVersion, version)));

        if (!canUpgrade) revert FactoryErrors.InvalidUpgrade();

        IAccount(account).upgradeAccount(
            versionInformation[version].implementation,
            versionInformation[version].registry,
            version,
            versionInformation[version].data
        );

        // unsafe cast: accountVersion <= latestAccountVersion, which is a uint88.
        emit AccountUpgraded(account, uint88(version));
    }
```

        uint256 oldVersion = ACCOUNT_VERSION;

        // Store new parameters.
        _getAddressSlot(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
        registry = newRegistry;

        // Prevent that Account is upgraded to a new version where the Numeraire can't be priced.
        if (newRegistry != oldRegistry && !IRegistry(newRegistry).inRegistry(numeraire)) {
            revert AccountErrors.InvalidRegistry();
        }

        // If a Creditor is set, new version should be compatible.
        if (creditor != address(0)) {
            (bool success,,,) = ICreditor(creditor).openMarginAccount(newVersion);
            if (!success) revert AccountErrors.InvalidAccountVersion();
        }

        // Hook on the new logic to finalize upgrade.
        // Used to eg. Remove exposure from old Registry and add exposure to the new Registry.
        // Extra data can be added by the Factory for complex instructions.
        this.upgradeHook(oldImplementation, oldRegistry, oldVersion, data);

        // Event emitted by Factory.
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Possible solution is to update numeraire also when user upgrade an account via `Factory.sol#upgradeAccountVersion()` function.
