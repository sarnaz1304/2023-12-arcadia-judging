# Wrong implementation of virtual shares and virtual assets to avoid share to asset rate manipulation.

## Summary
Protocol implemented virtual assets and virtual shares as described in detail by their recent Medium [post ](https://arcadiafinance.medium.com/arcadias-partnership-with-pashov-group-a46d413d3c52)to prevent share to asset rate manipulation as recommended by the previous audit. They use same value for both virtual shares and virtual assets, therefore it does not change anything in calculations and the previous issue is still present. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The previous [report ](https://github.com/arcadia-finance/arcadia-finance-audits/blob/main/audits-v2/PASHOV%20GROUP_Q12024.pdf)of the audit conducted by a security firm found that share to asset rate can be manipulated via liquidations. The mitigate that issue it was recommended that protocol uses an approach used by Yieldbox and OZ's latest ERC4626 implementation. 

Protocol tried to implement that approach by introducing VAS in tranche.sol. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/Tranche.sol#L103-L104


Openzeppelin recommendation regarding using virtual shares and assets is as follows:

**"The defense we propose is based on the approach used in [YieldBox](https://github.com/boringcrypto/YieldBox). It consists of two parts:
Use an offset between the "precision" of the representation of shares and assets. Said otherwise, we use more decimal places to represent the shares than the underlying token does to represent the assets.
Include virtual shares and virtual assets in the exchange rate computation. These virtual assets enforce the conversion rate when the vault is empty.
These two parts work together in enforcing the security of the vault."**

In the current protocol there is no offset between the "precision" of the representation of shares and assets. 
In [Yieldbox](https://github.com/boringcrypto/YieldBox/blob/master/contracts/YieldBoxRebase.sol) there is a 1:8 ratio between virtual asset and virtual shares. Similarly, Morpho labs [use ](https://github.com/morpho-org/morpho-blue/blob/main/src/libraries/SharesMathLib.sol) a ratio of 1:6 in their calculations. 

The current implementation of virtual asset and virtual shares as a single value(VAS) doesn't mitigate the issue previously identified. Adding the same number to both numerator and denominator does not change anything in respect to rounding if assigned a small value to VAS as expected. Assigning a higher value for VAS would lead to other problems in the system such as virtual shares stealing interest from user and virtual shares accumulating bad debt in significant amounts.



## Impact
The previous audit had marked the issue as medium but now with the introduction of donateToTranche function in LendingPool.sol, which can be called by anyone, the severity of this vulnerability increases to high since attackers have direct path for share manipulation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement correct way of assigning virtual asset and virtual shares so that there is an offset between the two values.
