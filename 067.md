# Tranches are not ERC4626 compliant

## Summary
Tranches are not ERC4626 compliant

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the readme, tranches are expected to be fully erc4626 compliant. 
However, there's an issue with their `preview` functions. Let's take a look at `previewMint` for example.
```solidity
    function previewMint(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256 assets) {
        // Cache totalSupply.
        uint256 supply = totalSupply;

        assets = supply == 0 ? shares : shares.mulDivUp(totalAssets() + VAS, supply + VAS);
    }
```
```solidity
   function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256 assets) {
        assets = LENDING_POOL.liquidityOf(address(this));
    }
```
```solidity
    function liquidityOf(address owner_) external view returns (uint256 assets) {
        // Avoid a second calculation of unrealised debt (expensive).
        // if interests are already synced this block.
        if (lastSyncedTimestamp != uint32(block.timestamp)) {
            // The total liquidity of a tranche equals the sum of the realised liquidity
            // of the tranche, and its pending interests.
            uint256 interest = calcUnrealisedDebt().mulDivDown(interestWeight[owner_], totalInterestWeight);
            unchecked {
                assets = realisedLiquidityOf[owner_] + interest;
            }
        } else {
            assets = realisedLiquidityOf[owner_];
        }
    }
```
As it can be seen, the function takes into account the accrued interest which should go towards the said tranche.
However, it does not take into account that if the tranche actually has 0 liquidity in it, it will get no part of the unrealized debt (as it will go towards the treasury)
```solidity
            for (uint256 i; i < trancheLength; ++i) {
                realisedLiquidity = realisedLiquidityOf[tranches[i]];
                // Don't pay interests to Tranches without liquidity.
                // Interests will go to treasury instead.
                if (realisedLiquidity == 0) continue;
```

This makes the preview functions return false info. Anything relying on it would not work as expected.

## Impact
Anything relying on the ERC4626 functions will not work properly

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the tranche's liquidity is 0
