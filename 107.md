# _getSqrtPrice method would return a wrong sqrtPrice of a pair when any of the underlying tokens has less than 18 decimals

## Summary
In UniswapV3AMM.sol {This asset module manages uniswap-v3 assets || positions , computes the value of positions e.t.c).The method _getSqrtPrice is used to get the sqrtPriceX96 giving the price_of_token0_in_usd && price_of_token1_in_usd.The SqrtPricex96  is given be =Sqrt(Price_of_base_to_quote)*2**96, the arcadia implementation takes another approach ,Price=1e18 of Quote/1e18 of Base  .The issue is that for tokens with decimals less than 1e18 the price quote-base price would be incorrect.
Lets take a quick example (A pool containing WETH| USDC the oracle returns a price of WETH as 2000e18 representing the price of 1e18 of WETH token and then the price of USDC as 1e30 representing the price of 1e18 USDC the exchange-rate used to get the SqrtPrice would result ->2000e18/1e30->2000*10^-12 instead of 2000, This price is used to get the SqrtPrice and would return a wrong sqrtPrice .
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
_getPrincipalAmounts() and other functionalities used to compute the amount of an asset would likely return a wrong amount.

##P.O.C->
This test was conducted assuming the price of WETH/USDC pool->2000 ->SqrtPrice=Sqrt(2000)*2**96=3.5431911422859144e+30

    function test_getSqrtPrice() external view {
        uint256 price_of_usdc = 1e30;
        uint256 price_of_eth = 2000e18;
        console.log(
            "The SqrtPrice %s",
            _getSqrtPriceX96(price_of_eth, price_of_usdc)
        );
    }
}
The results from the test returns the sqrtPrice as 3.5431*10**24 instead of 3.5431*10**30

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation:A simple fix would be scaling prices based on the asset decimals
