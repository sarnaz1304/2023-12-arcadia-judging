# Contract functionality may silently fail due to hardcoded Permit2 contract address not available on some L2s.

## Summary
Contract functionality may silently fail due to Permit2 contract not available on some L2s.

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the chains that the contract will be deployed on, it is possible that this code will be used for other L2s as well.

The AccountV1 contract hardcoded the Permit2 contract address to `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3` . This is correct for some L2s, but also not on some L2s. For example, 
- zkSync: https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3
- Manta network: https://pacific-explorer.manta.network/address/0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3
- Mantle network: https://explorer.mantle.xyz/address/0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3

When `_transferFromOwnerWithPermit` is invoked, the function will fail.

## Impact
Contract may silently fail until the Permit2 functionality is used by the users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either 
- Assign the permit2 address in the constructor, or
- Validate the existence of the contract address in the constructor, so deployment does not pass silently
