# Termination rewards paid out to last bidder could be bigger than `openDebt`

## Summary
Settling auctions through the unhappy flow causes artificial liquidity to be paid out the terminator when the termination reward is bigger than the open debt being covered.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Unhappy flow is a scenario that triggers after bidders have failed to pay out the debt owed by an account or the the cut-off time has passed. It's the "bad" scenario as it incurs losses on the protocol and the LPs.

Liquidations that are settled in the unhappy flow can add artificial liquidity to the terminator's balance as it fails to check if the termination reward being paid out is less than the open debt.

The part we're interested in lies inside of `LendingPool::settleLiquidationUnhappyFlow()`:

```solidity
if (openDebt > terminationReward + liquidationPenalty) {
    // "openDebt" is bigger than pending liquidation incentives.
    // No incentives will be paid out, and a default event is triggered.
    unchecked {
        badDebt = openDebt - terminationReward - liquidationPenalty;
    }

    totalRealisedLiquidity = uint128(totalRealisedLiquidity - badDebt);
    _processDefault(badDebt);
} else {
    uint256 remainder = liquidationPenalty + terminationReward - openDebt;
    if (openDebt >= liquidationPenalty) {
        // "openDebt" is bigger than the "liquidationPenalty" but smaller than the total pending liquidation incentives.
        // Don't pay out the "liquidationPenalty" to Lps, partially pay out the "terminator".
        realisedLiquidityOf[terminator] += remainder;
    } else {
        // "openDebt" is smaller than the "liquidationPenalty".
        // Fully pay out the "terminator" and partially pay out the "liquidationPenalty".
        realisedLiquidityOf[terminator] += terminationReward;
        _syncLiquidationFee(remainder - terminationReward);
    }
    totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + remainder);
}
```

We can see here that if `openDebt > terminationReward + liquidationPenalty` is true, code goes into the `if` block's code. The `else` block handles the opposite case. Inside of it, we can see that the first condition is `openDebt >= liquidationPenalty` and that the block is responsible for paying out the liquidation rewards. The second one is the `else`, which pays the termination rewards, but it fails to apply the same check. In the scenario where `terminationReward` is indeed bigger than `openDebt`, fake liquidity will be introduced for the `terminator` that the protocol isn't actually able to cover. The `totalRealisedLiquidity` is also updating wrongly at the end:

```solidity
totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + remainder);
```

It's correctly updating for the first scenario, but not for the scenario described above when `terminationReward > openDebt`.

## Impact
Artificial liquidity being introduced into the system by terminators when `terminationReward` is bigger than `openDebt`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The following change should be applied:

```diff
-} else {-
+} else if (openDebt >= terminationReward) {
```

The following line should also be refactored:

```solidity
totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + remainder);
```

It should be added to both blocks and the `totalRealisedLiquidity` incremented by `terminationReward` or `liquidationPenalty` instead of `remainder`, which is unneeded and should be removed.
