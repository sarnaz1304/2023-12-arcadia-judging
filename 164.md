# Missing totalAssets() == 0 checks might DOS the protocol permanently


## Summary
previewWithdraw rounds down, which results in burning less shares than realisedDebt, which can lead to totalAssets() = 0 but shares!=0 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address account) internal returns (uint256 shares) {
        // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewWithdraw.
        if ((shares = previewWithdraw(assets)) == 0) revert DebtTokenErrors.ZeroShares(); ///@audit previewWithdraw rounds down

        _burn(account, shares);

        realisedDebt -= assets; ///@audit but debt is decreased by assets
		...
    }
```

```solidity
    function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256) {
        // Cache totalSupply.
        uint256 supply = totalSupply;

        return supply == 0 ? assets : assets.mulDivDown(supply, totalAssets());
        ///@audit ^ round down
    }
```

So this can lead to an edge case where there are some dust amount of shares left but realizedDebt =0.  Which will result in divide by 0 and multiply by 0 in previewWithdraw & previewMint respectively.


## Impact

1. Divide by 0 in previewWithdraw
2. Multiple by 0 in previewMint

## Recommendation

Add totalAssets() == 0 check in the preview functions.
