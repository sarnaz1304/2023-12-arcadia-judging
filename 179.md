# Wrong Implementation in the openMarginAccount Function

## Summary
Wrong Implementation in the openMarginAccount Function of the AccountV1 contract as New MarginAccount is Opened before closing new One instead of the other way round
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function openMarginAccount(address newCreditor)
        external
        onlyOwner
        nonReentrant
        notDuringAuction
        updateActionTimestamp
    {
        (address[] memory assetAddresses, uint256[] memory assetIds, uint256[] memory assetAmounts) =
            generateAssetData();

        // Cache old Creditor.
        address oldCreditor = creditor;
        if (oldCreditor == newCreditor) revert AccountErrors.CreditorAlreadySet();

        // Remove the exposures of the Account for the old Creditor.
        if (oldCreditor != address(0)) {
            IRegistry(registry).batchProcessWithdrawal(oldCreditor, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);
        }

        // Check if all assets in the Account are allowed by the new Creditor
        // and add the exposure of the account for the new Creditor.
        IRegistry(registry).batchProcessDeposit(newCreditor, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);

        // Open margin account for the new Creditor.
>>>        _openMarginAccount(newCreditor);

        // A margin account can only be opened for one Creditor at a time.
        // If set, close the margin account for the old Creditor.
        if (oldCreditor != address(0)) {
            // closeMarginAccount() checks if there is still an open position (open liabilities) of the Account for the old Creditor.
            // If so, the function reverts.
 >>>           ICreditor(oldCreditor).closeMarginAccount(address(this));
        }
    }
```
The code provided above shows how openMarginAccount(...) function is implemented, as pointed out in the pointer above the Protocol Opned a new MarginAccount before closing the old MarginAccount, this could cause  problem for the protocol due to clashing of variable state values  between the old data and the new data, before A new Margin would be opened the old one should be closed first to avoid counter interactions

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should make necessary adjustments to ensure a new openMarginAccount is only opened after the old one has been closed
