# It is possible to create more than `256` tranches.

## Summary

The protocol invariant maximum number of associated tranches for a single lending pool (`256`) can be invalidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [`README.md`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/README.md#q-add-links-to-relevant-protocol-resources) for the contest specifically highlights the invariant that:

> No more than 256 tranches to a single lending pool.

However, this upper limit is not enforced.

In the snippet below, we demonstrate that an authorized owner can add more tranches than the intended protocol invariant maximum:

### [ðŸ“„ AddTranche.fuzz.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/test/fuzz/LendingPool/AddTranche.fuzz.t.sol)

```solidity
/// @dev Demonstrate that we can add an arbitrary number of tranches.
function test_tooManyTranches() public {

    /// @dev Here, we iterate past the invariant `256` tranches. This can continue indefinitely.
    for (uint256 i; i < 256 + 1; ++i) {

      address trancheAddress = address(uint160(i + 0x6969));

      vm.prank(users.creatorAddress);
        pool_.addTranche(trancheAddress, 10 /* interestWeight */);

    }
}
```

This issue likely arises from the fact that a `uint8` is used to uniquely identify lending pool tranches, the assumption being that this value cannot normally overflow outside of an `unchecked` block.

However, we type cast the array length directly to a `uint8` directly, resulting in truncation of the identifier, leading in the insertion of tranches past the intended maximum:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Adds a tranche to the Lending Pool.
 * @param tranche The address of the Tranche.
 * @param interestWeight_ The interest weight of the specific Tranche.
 * @dev The order of the tranches is important, the most senior tranche is added first at index 0, the most junior at the last index.
 * @dev Each Tranche is an ERC4626 contract.
 * @dev The interest weight of each Tranche determines the relative share of the yield (interest payments) that goes to its Liquidity providers.
 */
function addTranche(address tranche, uint16 interestWeight_) external onlyOwner processInterests {
    if (auctionsInProgress > 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.AuctionOngoing();
    if (isTranche[tranche]) revert LendingPoolErrors.TrancheAlreadyExists();

    totalInterestWeight += interestWeight_;
    interestWeightTranches.push(interestWeight_);
    interestWeight[tranche] = interestWeight_;

@>  uint8 trancheIndex = uint8(tranches.length); /// @audit integer_overflow
    tranches.push(tranche);
    isTranche[tranche] = true;

    emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(tranche, trancheIndex, interestWeight_);
}
```

This permits both arbitrary numbers of tranches to be associated with a single [`LendingPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol), defeating the protocol invariant and introducing a number of highly undesirable second-order effects to pool operation due to identifier collision.

## Impact

Medium - we demonstrate that we have undermined an explicitly-documented protocol invariant, however unlikely this would be to happen in production.

    if (auctionsInProgress > 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.AuctionOngoing();
    if (isTranche[tranche]) revert LendingPoolErrors.TrancheAlreadyExists();

    totalInterestWeight += interestWeight_;
    interestWeightTranches.push(interestWeight_);
    interestWeight[tranche] = interestWeight_;

    uint8 trancheIndex = uint8(tranches.length);
    tranches.push(tranche);
    isTranche[tranche] = true;

}
```

## Tool used

Foundry

## Recommendation

Use [`SafeCastLib.safeCastTo8(uint8)`](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/c892309933b25c03d32b1b0d674df7ae292ba925/src/utils/SafeCastLib.sol#L188) to implicitly throw for excessive numbers of tranches.

### [ðŸ“„ LendingPool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol)

```diff
- uint8 trancheIndex = uint8(tranches.length);
+ uint8 trancheIndex = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo8(tranches.length);
tranches.push(tranche);
isTranche[tranche] = true;
```
