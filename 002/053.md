# The invariant that no more than 256 tranches to a single lending pool can be broken

## Summary

Relevant protocol resources mention the invariant that no more than 256 tranches to a single lending pool. But this is not checked in the code, the number of tranches can be greater than 256.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the invariant description, the number of tranches to a single lending pool should never be more than 256.
The code implementation of `LendingPool.sol#addTranche` is as follows.

```solidity
function addTranche(address tranche, uint16 interestWeight_) external onlyOwner processInterests {
    if (auctionsInProgress > 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.AuctionOngoing();
    if (isTranche[tranche]) revert LendingPoolErrors.TrancheAlreadyExists();

    totalInterestWeight += interestWeight_;
    interestWeightTranches.push(interestWeight_);
    interestWeight[tranche] = interestWeight_;

    uint8 trancheIndex = uint8(tranches.length);
    tranches.push(tranche);
    isTranche[tranche] = true;

    emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(tranche, trancheIndex, interestWeight_);
}
```

In the code logic of `addTranche`, the current number of tranches is not checked. When the owner adds too many tranches, it is very likely that the invariant will be broken.

## Impact

The invariant that no more than 256 tranches to a single lending pool will be broken, this may cause some functional abnormalities.
The following code is a POC for this scenario, just add `test_AddTranche_More_than_256` function to `AddTranche.fuzz.t.sol`.

```solidity
function test_AddTranche_More_than_256() public {
    vm.startPrank(users.creatorAddress);
    for(uint160 i; i < 257; ++i)
    {
        pool_.addTranche(address(i), 10);
    }
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

## Recommendation

The number of tranches needs to be checked to ensure that it is not greater than 256.
