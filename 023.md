# `ACCOUNT_VERSION` is always 1, which could lead to unauthorized upgrade

## Summary
The `ACCOUNT_VERSION` variable defined in the `AccountV1` contract is constant and is kept as `1`.  Every time the function [AccountV1::upgradeAccount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L192C85-L225) is called, the `ACCOUNT_VERSION` is used as `oldVersion` and the version information of the `AccountV1` is not changed. This causes the confusion that the account has upgraded to `newVersion` but remains to `ACCOUNT_VERSION`. Also, since `ACCOUNT_VERSION` is also queried by `Factory::upgradeAccountVersion`, the `currentVersion` will always be `1` and  `canUpgrade` check will also be affected, leading to an unauthorized upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the contract `AccountV1`, the [ACCOUNT_VERSION](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L44) is defined as constant `1`.
```solidity
    uint256 public constant ACCOUNT_VERSION = 1; 
```

So, in the function [AccountV1::upgradeAccount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L202-L217), the `oldVersion` is wrong regarded as `ACCOUNT_VERSION` which is `1`, and input `newVersion` is nowhere updated in the contract.
```solidity
        uint256 oldVersion = ACCOUNT_VERSION;

        // Store new parameters.
        _getAddressSlot(IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
        registry = newRegistry;

        // Prevent that Account is upgraded to a new version where the Numeraire can't be priced.
        if (newRegistry != oldRegistry && !IRegistry(newRegistry).inRegistry(numeraire)) {
            revert AccountErrors.InvalidRegistry();
        }

        // If a Creditor is set, new version should be compatible.
        if (creditor != address(0)) {
            (bool success,,,) = ICreditor(creditor).openMarginAccount(newVersion); // @follow-up previous account?
            if (!success) revert AccountErrors.InvalidAccountVersion();
        }

        // Hook on the new logic to finalize upgrade.
        // Used to eg. Remove exposure from old Registry and add exposure to the new Registry.
        // Extra data can be added by the Factory for complex instructions.
        this.upgradeHook(oldImplementation, oldRegistry, oldVersion, data);
```

As a result, even if the `account` has been upgraded, its `ACCOUNT_VERSION` will remain to return version `1` which is incorrect.

Since the function `AccountV1::ACCOUNT_VERSION()` is queried by [Factory::upgradeAccountVersion](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Factory.sol#L145-L149) as `currentVersion` and later proved via `MerkleProofLib.verify`, this could lead to **unauthorized upgrade**.
```solidity
        uint256 currentVersion = IAccount(account).ACCOUNT_VERSION();
        bool canUpgrade =
            MerkleProofLib.verify(proofs, versionRoot, keccak256(abi.encodePacked(currentVersion, version)));

        if (!canUpgrade) revert FactoryErrors.InvalidUpgrade();
```

Consider the following scenario:
1. Currently, the wallet has v1, v2 and v3.
2. Only upgrade from v1 to v3, v1 to v2 is allowed, and the `versionRoot` is set via `setNewAccountInfo`.
3. A user has upgraded to v2. Even though v2 to v3 is not supported, the user could still use the proof of v1-v3 upgrade, and bypass the `MerkleProofLib.verify` since `ACCOUNT_VERSION` is always 1 and only (1,3) version pair is examined and verified. This could lead to unauthorized upgrades which will cause potential fund loss/stuck or failure for users.


## Impact
The `ACCOUNT_VERSION` variable defined in `AccountV1` contract is constant and is kept as `1`. This confuses when the account has upgraded to `newVersion` but remains to be `ACCOUNT_VERSION`. Also, since the function `AccountV1::ACCOUNT_VERSION()` is queried by [Factory::upgradeAccountVersion]() as `currentVersion` and later proved via `MerkleProofLib.verify`, this could lead to **unauthorized upgrade**.

## Recommendation

Don't define `ACCOUNT_VERSION` as constant, move it to `AccountStorageV1` and let it vary with each upgrade.
