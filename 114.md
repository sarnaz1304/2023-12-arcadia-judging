# Incorrect handling of bad debt.

## Summary
There is an `invariant` for the `LendingPool` in the `README`: `totalRealisedLiquidity equals sum of all claims of individual LPs.`
This can be broken in some cases.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is one `tranche` in the `pool`.
Normal `depositing` and `borrowing` have been done in this `pool`.
Due to market conditions, some large `accounts` are `liquidated`, and unfortunately, `bad debt` occurred.

There is not sufficient `liquidity` in the `tranche` to process `bad debt`. 
For example, one `account` borrows all `liquidity` of this `tranche`, and `bad debt` occurs from this `account`. 
As a result, the `bad debt` becomes larger than the `liquidity` due to `interest`.

As you can see, `bad debt` is removed from `totalRealisedLiquidity`.
```solidity
function settleLiquidationUnhappyFlow(
    address account,
    uint256 startDebt,
    uint256 minimumMargin_,
    address terminator
) external whenLiquidationNotPaused onlyLiquidator processInterests {
    totalRealisedLiquidity = uint128(totalRealisedLiquidity - badDebt);
    _processDefault(badDebt);
}
```
But the liquidity of the tranche is smaller than the bad debt and there are some unprocessed `bad debts`, and we are ignoring them.
```solidity
function _processDefault(uint256 badDebt) internal {
    maxBurnable = realisedLiquidityOf[tranche];
    realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] = 0;
    _popTranche(i, tranche);
    unchecked {
        badDebt -= maxBurnable;
    }
}
```
As a result, `totalRealisedLiquidity`  becomes less than the sum of all claims of individual `LPs`, and the `invariant` is broken.

Actually, this will affect the newly added `tranche` in the future because other `LPs`, including the `treasury`, can still claim their earnings without considering the occurred bad debt, and the actual `liquidity` from new tranche will be removed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should remove the remaining `bad debt` from the `treasury` or other `LPs`' holdings.
