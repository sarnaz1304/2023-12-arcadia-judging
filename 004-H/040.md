# Lending pools that accept both ERC777 and UniswapV3 positions as collateral can be drained

## Summary
Depositing a fully compliant ERC777 token with a UniswapV3 position as collateral allows an attacker to steal funds and potentially drain the lending pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [AccountV1::deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L818) function allows to deposit multiple assets at once. It first executes [Registry::batchProcessDeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L427) and then proceeds to transfer the assets from the caller to the AccountV1 contract. 

[Registry::batchProcessDeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L427) will execute a downstream call to [UniswapV3AM::_addAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/UniswapV3/UniswapV3AM.sol#L94) for UniswapV3 positions, which caches the amount of liquidity of the position:
```solidity
function _addAsset(uint256 assetId) internal {
     ...
    (,, address token0, address token1,,,, uint128 liquidity,,,,) = NON_FUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER.positions(assetId);
     assetToLiquidity[assetId] = liquidity;
     ...
}
```

This can be exploited when combined with a deposit of a fully compliant ERC777 token that implements a [tokensToSend](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777#hooks) hook that executes an external call to the address the token is being transferred from. This is possible in the following way:

1. Call [AccountV1::deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L818) to deposit an ERC777 token and a UniswapV3 position: `[ERC777, UniswapV3 position]`
2. When [Registry::batchProcessDeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L427) is executed, [UniswapV3AM::_addAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/UniswapV3/UniswapV3AM.sol#L94) will cache the current liquidity of the UniwapV3 position
3. When [AccountV1::_depositERC20()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L852) on the ERC777 token is executed the attacker gets a callback and takes control of the call flow
4. The attacker decreases the liquidity of the UniswapV3 position, this is possible because the UniswapV3 position NFT has not been transferred yet
5. [AccountV1::_depositERC721()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L855) is executed and the UniswapV3 position is deposited
6. Because the liquidity of the UniswapV3 position has been cached in step `2` the protocol will think the position is valued more than it is
7. Borrow assets for a value higher than the collateral and create bad debt in the protocol

### POC
With the test suite the project provided creating a POC for this attack would take a lot of time. A complete POC would require modifications to the custom UniswapV3 fork test-suite provided by the team in DIscord to add ERC777 token support and I think the idea is straightforward enough to not need a runnable POC. If one is necessary I will create an external repo with a functioning one.
 
## Impact
An attacker can drain lending pools/creditors that accept both ERC777 and UniswapV3 positions as collateral.

## Recommendation
The root cause of the described issue is that the `liquidity` of a UniswapV3 position is cached, but since removing this would create surface for other attacks a good idea might be to check the liquidity of the UniswapV3 position again after the deposits have been executed and make sure is equal to the initial one. 

An additional thing to consider is that this kind of attack could be used with future added assets in other ways, it might be worth considering moving the [batchProcessDeposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L427) call after the deposits are executed, but I'm not entirely sure this does not introduce other attack vectors.
