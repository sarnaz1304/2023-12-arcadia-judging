# Approval in StakedStargateAM::_stake() doesn't use safeApprove

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [StakedStargateAM::_stake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Stargate-Finance/StakedStargateAM.sol#L82) approves `LP_STAKING_TIME` to transfer an amount of `asset` (LP tokens) from the StakedStargateAM contract itself.

The README claims that safe functions from solmate are used to deal with non-compliant ERC20 tokens but this is not true in this case.

## Impact
StakedStargateAM might be incompatible with non-compliant ERC20 tokens.

## Recommendation

In [StakedStargateAM::_stake()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/Stargate-Finance/StakedStargateAM.sol#L82) use solmate `safeApprove` to approve `LP_STAKING_TIME` to transfer tokens from StakedStargateAM.
