# The liquidity in the Uniswap position cannot be accurately calculated as collateral.

## Summary
When adding `liquidity` using `Uniswap V3 Position` to the `account`, we reserve the current `liquidity`.
However, even if anyone increases the `liquidity` thereafter, these additional amounts cannot be included in the `collateral` calculation.
## Vulnerability Detail
We can deposit our `Uniswap V3` `position` into the `account`.
```solidity
function _addAsset(uint256 assetId) internal {
    (,, address token0, address token1,,,, uint128 liquidity,,,,) = NON_FUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER.positions(assetId);
    if (liquidity == 0) revert ZeroLiquidity();

    // The liquidity of the Liquidity Position is stored in the Asset Module,
    // not fetched from the NonfungiblePositionManager.
    // Since liquidity of a position can be increased by a non-owner,
    // the max exposure checks could otherwise be circumvented.
    assetToLiquidity[assetId] = liquidity;  // @audit, here

    bytes32 assetKey = _getKeyFromAsset(address(NON_FUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER), assetId);
    bytes32[] memory underlyingAssetKeys = new bytes32[](2);
    underlyingAssetKeys[0] = _getKeyFromAsset(token0, 0);
    underlyingAssetKeys[1] = _getKeyFromAsset(token1, 0);
    assetToUnderlyingAssets[assetKey] = underlyingAssetKeys;
}
```
I can see in the comment that the reason for storing the current `liquidity` is to prevent `max exposure checks`.
Any malicious user can increase `liquidity` for this `Uniswap position` because `Uniswap` allows anyone to increase `liquidity` for any `position`. 

However, the `max exposure check` is only conducted during the deposit time, once. 
After that, even if a malicious user increases the `liquidity` with bad intentions, it only provides more `liquidity` to the `owner` of this `position`, and the malicious user loses their funds.
In short, storing current `liquidity` is useless and introduces unfair elements for users.

- The user deposits the `Uniswap V3 position` into the `account`.
- He discovers that his `account` is nearly `liquidatable`.
  So he decides to increase the `collateral` value of the `account`.
- To do so, he adds `liquidity` to the `Uniswap position`.
- However, these increased `liquidity` cannot be included in the `collateral` calculation.
  We use the stored `liquidity`.
```solidity
function _getPosition(uint256 assetId) {
   liquidity = uint128(assetToLiquidity[assetId]);

    if (liquidity > 0) {
        (,, token0, token1,, tickLower, tickUpper,,,,,) = NON_FUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER.positions(assetId);
    } else {
        // Only used as an off-chain view function by getValue() to return the value of a non deposited Liquidity Position.
        (,, token0, token1,, tickLower, tickUpper, liquidity,,,,) = NON_FUNGIBLE_POSITION_MANAGER.positions(assetId);
    }
}
```
## Impact
As a result, even though the `account` has enough `collateral`, it can be `liquidated`, and furthermore, the `Uniswap position` can be sold at an extremely low price.

To prevent this, should we inform users not to add `liquidity` to the `Uniswap position` in order to increase `collateral`?

## Recommendation
We should use the current `liquidity` in all calculations.
