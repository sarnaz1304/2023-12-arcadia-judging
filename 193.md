# M-5 Lack of Support for Depositing and Withdrawing ERC777 Tokens

## Summary
While the protocol's documentation asserts its capability to handle both depositing and withdrawing ERC777 tokens, an examination of the provided code reveals a notable absence of functionality for these operations. Unlike the documented support for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens, there is no corresponding implementation for ERC777 tokens within the codebase.
[**`code`**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L901-1000)
 This discrepancy raises concerns about the protocol's adherence to its stated features and the reliability of its implementation. For further clarification, the documentation link can be accessed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/README.md).

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is twofold:

1. The absence of code to handle depositing ERC777 tokens prevents users from adding these tokens to the protocol as intended.
2. Similarly, the lack of code to withdraw ERC777 tokens means users cannot retrieve their ERC777 tokens once deposited.

## Impact
This issue leads to a significant discrepancy between the promised functionality in the protocol's documentation and the actual implementation. Users expecting to deposit and withdraw ERC777 tokens may face obstacles.




## Code Snippet
(No specific code snippet provided, as the issue pertains to the absence of code related to ERC777 token deposits and withdrawals.)


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Implement ERC777 Support:** Develop and integrate functionalities to handle both depositing and withdrawing ERC777 tokens into the protocol. This involves updating the contract logic to accommodate ERC777 token transfers accurately.
2. **Documentation Update**: Update the protocol's documentation to reflect the implemented functionalities accurately. Ensure that users have access to up-to-date information regarding supported features, including ERC777 token depositing and withdrawing.
