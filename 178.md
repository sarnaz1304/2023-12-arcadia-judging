# H-2: Degradation of Collateral Health Post-Liquidation

## Summary
The liquidation process can inadvertently decrease an account's health score due to the non-uniform Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios of different assets. When a high LTV asset is liquidated, the reduction in borrowing power may not be proportionate to the reduction in liabilities, potentially leading to a lower health score and requiring multiple liquidations to improve the account's status.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a liquidation occurs, the impact on the account's health score can be disproportionate due to varying Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios across different tokens. Specifically, liquidating a token with a higher LTV can lead to a reduced borrowing power relative to the reduction in liabilities, potentially worsening the account's health score. This can necessitate multiple liquidation events to improve the health score, during which time bad debt may persist, posing a risk to the protocol.

For example, consider an account with the following composition:

    Liabilities: 1000 USDT
    Assets: 6 ETH (each valued at $100, 100% LTV) and 1 BTC (valued at $400, 50% LTV)
    Initial Health Factor: (6 * $100 + 0.5 * $400) / $1000 = 0.80

If ETH is prioritized for liquidation due to its larger share of the portfolio, a 50% liability reduction would result in:

    Liabilities after liquidation: 500 USDT
    Remaining assets: 1 ETH and 1 BTC
    New Health Factor: ($100 + 0.5 * $400) / $500 = 0.60

This scenario shows a decrease in the health score from 0.80 to 0.60 post-liquidation.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to a scenario where bad debt remains in the system for an extended period, as multiple liquidations are required to restore the health score. It exposes the protocol to the risk of maintaining insolvent positions, which can undermine its financial stability and user trust.

In case of bidder :- When a liquidation occurs and a bidder opts to purchase high LTV assets, the account's total borrowing power decreases more significantly than the liabilities. This is due to the higher LTV assets contributing more to the borrowing power. As a result, the health score, which is the ratio of borrowing power to liabilities, may decrease, potentially leaving the account in a weaker financial position post-liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a liquidation strategy that prioritizes the sale of assets in a manner that is most likely to improve the health score, potentially by focusing on lower LTV assets first.
