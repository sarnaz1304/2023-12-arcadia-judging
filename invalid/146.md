# The permissionless variant of `LendingPoolGuardian#unpause` will cause race conditions between repayment and liquidation

## Summary

When the permissionless variant of `LendingPoolGuardian#unpause` is called it will simultaneously unlock repayment and liquidation. While repayment is blocked, users who are underwater cannot repay their position ahead of time. This creates race conditions when called that will lead to large numbers of users being unfairly liquidated as they were given no time to repay.

## Vulnerability Detail

[LendingPoolGuardian.sol#L148-L152](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/guardians/LendingPoolGuardian.sol#L148-L152)

    function unpause() external override afterCoolDownOf(30 days) {
        emit PauseFlagsUpdated(
            repayPaused = false, withdrawPaused = false, borrowPaused, depositPaused, liquidationPaused = false
        );
    }

As shown above, withdrawals and liquidations are unlocked at the same time, those who have been blocked from repaying will now have to race to repay their loan before they are queued for liquidation. While it is true that users can still repay even during the liquidation process, the liquidation fees are applied immediately causing the user to pay back excess debt.

## Impact

Race conditions after unpausing will cause users to pay unfair fees best case and worst case they will be unfairly liquidated.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There should be a grace timer after liquidation have been resumed so that no users can be liquidate for some amount of time after they resume.
