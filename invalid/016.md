# The hidden criteria "Length can be maximally 3" may make `checkOracleSequence` return wrong value

## Summary
There is no check of the length of the input array in [BitPackingLib::pack](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/libraries/BitPackingLib.sol#L24). Later in the processing of `oracleSequence`, [BitPackingLib::unpack](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/libraries/BitPackingLib.sol#L67-L69) has a hidden criteria that `the length of chain can be maximally 3`. If the length exceeds 3, **BitPackingLib.unpack() can maximally return arrays of length 3**. Since this criterion is not cited nor explicitly checked, if the user inputs a sequence with a length greater than `3`(for example, 4-7), the input would be truncated without reverting. Two scenarios would happen: 1. An unqualified sequence would accidentally be considered valid. 2. A sequence that meets other criteria will be considered unqualified with the wrong reason being given.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the [BitPackingLib::pack](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/libraries/BitPackingLib.sol#L24) function, even though the array length is required to be equal or less than 3, it is not explicitly checked.
```solidity
    function pack(bool[] memory boolValues, uint80[] memory uintValues) internal pure returns (bytes32 packedData) {
        assembly {
            // Get the length of the arrays.
            let length := mload(boolValues)

            // Store the total length in the two right most bits
            // Length is always smaller than or equal to 3.
            packedData := length
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
```

Later, when the `packedData` is used as `oracleSequence` in [unpack](), it can only maximally return arrays of length 3 since `0x3` is hard-coded. So, if the length is 5, the first 1 element is parsed from the `oracleSequence`. If the length is 6, the first 2 elements are parsed from the `oracleSequence`.  If the length is 7, the first 3 elements are parsed from the `oracleSequence`.
```solidity
    function unpack(bytes32 packedData) internal pure returns (bool[] memory boolValues, uint256[] memory uintValues) {
        assembly {
            // Use bitmask to extract the array length from the rightmost 2 bits.
            // Length is always smaller than or equal to 3.
            let length := and(packedData, 0x3)
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
```
Since in [Registry::checkOracleSequence](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L286-L290), the value is directly used to check the criteria(Ex. The oracle must be previously added to the Registry and must still be active...).  If the user inputs a sequence with a length greater than `3`(for example, 5-7), the input would be truncated without reverting.
```solidity
    function checkOracleSequence(bytes32 oracleSequence) external view returns (bool) {
        (bool[] memory baseToQuoteAsset, uint256[] memory oracles) = oracleSequence.unpack();
        uint256 length = oracles.length;
        if (length == 0) revert RegistryErrors.Min1Oracle();
        // Length can be maximally 3, but no need to explicitly check it.
        // BitPackingLib.unpack() can maximally return arrays of length 3.
        ...
    }
```

There are two scenarios to consider:

- An unqualified sequence would accidentally be considered valid
    - When the input is with oracle pairs `(A, USD), (B, USD), (B,C), (C,D), (D,E)`, the total length is 5.
    - After unpack is called, only `(A, USD)` pair is parsed.
    - Since the parsed path ended with `USD`, the `checkOracleSequence` would return `true`, but in the real scenario, it should be false.

- A sequence that meets other criteria will be considered unqualified with the wrong reason being given
    -  When the input is with oracle pairs `(A, B), (B, C), (C,D), (D,USD)`, the total length is 4.
    -  After unpack is called, the array length is 0. Since `0x4 & 0x3 = 0`.
    - The function would revert with `RegistryErrors.Min1Oracle()` which is incorrect.


## Impact
If the user inputs a sequence with a length greater then `3`(for example, 4-7), the input would be truncated without reverting. Two scenarios would happen: 1. An unqualified sequence would accidentally be considered valid. 2. A sequence that meets other criteria will be considered unqualified with the wrong reason being given. This is not robust or fault-tolerance.

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation
A few things should be done:
1. limit the input array length in `BitPackingLib::pack`
2. Check the byte length in `BitPackingLib::unpack` to guarantee that `packedData` has no bytes unvisited after the iteration.
