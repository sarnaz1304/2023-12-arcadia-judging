# Wrong Bid Price Calculation

## Summary
The pricing function for bidding price at `_calculateBidPrice` is wrong. It should have been further divided by 10^2

## Vulnerability Detail
Let us look at the code snippet itself
```solidity
            price = (
                auctionInformation_.startDebt * totalShare
                    * (
                        LogExpMath.pow(auctionInformation_.base, timePassed)
                            * (auctionInformation_.startPriceMultiplier - minPriceMultiplier_)
                            + 1e18 * uint256(minPriceMultiplier_)
                    )
            ) / 1e26;
```
The denominator should have been 1e28

1e18 (to account for the normalization in numerator) * 1e6 (to signify total shares) * 1e4 (dividing multipliers with 1e4 provides the apt fraction)

The wrong code has been written without accounting for 4 decimal precision of multiplier

## Impact
`bid` won't work because price won't be calculated properly, and hence, `LendingPool::auctionRepay` will be called with faulty params

## Recommendation
Kindly use 1e28 as denominator
