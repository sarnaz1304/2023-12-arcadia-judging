# Liquidator can unfairly liquidate a users asset

## Summary
Liquidator can unfairly liquidate a users asset even when it should not be liquidatable in the AccountV1 contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function auctionBid(
        address[] memory assetAddresses,
        uint256[] memory assetIds,
        uint256[] memory assetAmounts,
        address bidder
    ) external onlyLiquidator nonReentrant {
        _withdraw(assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts, bidder);
    }
```
The code above shows how Liquidator handles withdrawal through the auctionBid function, the problem is that Liquidator can unfairly liquidate a user due to absence of necessary validations examples of which can be seen in how withdrawal was handled at [L896](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L896) of the same contract
## Impact
Liquidator can unfairly liquidate a users asset even when it should not be liquidatable in the AccountV1 contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Protocol should ensure necessary validations to prevent liquidator from unfairly liquidating a User without necessary validation has been done
