# Liquadator Address Can be Set  Even when There is no Creditor

## Summary
Liquadator Address Can be Set  Even when There is no Creditor
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   // The contract address of the liquidator, address 0 if no creditor is set.
    address public liquidator;
```
As noted in the comment description of liquidator variable above, liquidator should always be Address(0) if there is no Creditor, how this important expectation and be bypassed and taken advantage of in AccountV1.sol contract
```solidity
function _openMarginAccount(address creditor_) internal {
        (bool success, address numeraire_, address liquidator_, uint256 minimumMargin_) =
            ICreditor(creditor_).openMarginAccount(ACCOUNT_VERSION);
        if (!success) revert AccountErrors.InvalidAccountVersion();

        minimumMargin = uint96(minimumMargin_);
        if (numeraire != numeraire_) _setNumeraire(numeraire_);

>>>        emit MarginAccountChanged(creditor = creditor_, liquidator = liquidator_);
    }
```
The code above shows how liquidator if set as noted by the pointer in the code above, a track down of creditor address usage in the _openMarginAccount(...) function down to the openMarginAccount(...) external function provided below where it was called from shows that newCreditor was never confirmed not to be address(0) before liquidator address is set which is againt Protocol Expectation and code execution, therefore liuidator would be able to interact with contracts when the necessary creditor has not been set. 
```solidity
  function openMarginAccount(address newCreditor)
        external
        onlyOwner
        nonReentrant
        notDuringAuction
        updateActionTimestamp
    {
        (address[] memory assetAddresses, uint256[] memory assetIds, uint256[] memory assetAmounts) =
            generateAssetData();

        // Cache old Creditor.
        address oldCreditor = creditor;
        if (oldCreditor == newCreditor) revert AccountErrors.CreditorAlreadySet();

        // Remove the exposures of the Account for the old Creditor.
        if (oldCreditor != address(0)) {
            IRegistry(registry).batchProcessWithdrawal(oldCreditor, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);
        }

        // Check if all assets in the Account are allowed by the new Creditor
        // and add the exposure of the account for the new Creditor.
        IRegistry(registry).batchProcessDeposit(newCreditor, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);

        // Open margin account for the new Creditor.
>>>        _openMarginAccount(newCreditor);
...
```
A significance of this report can be noted from how _openMarginAccount(...) function called is handled in the same contract at [L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L179), _openMarginAccount(...)  is only called when it is confirmed that creditor is not address(0)
## Impact
Liquadator Address Can interact with contract when there is no Creditor

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Just as mandated at [L179](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L179) of the contract, newCreditor to be called with openMarginAccount(...) should be confirmed not to be empty to avoid Liquidator being able to interact with contract when there is no Creditor
