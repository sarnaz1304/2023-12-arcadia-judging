# Liquidation penatly should only be paid by account owner

## Summary
In `settleLiquidationUnhappyFlow` the liquidation penatly is being paid by the LP providers. Liquidation penalty is something which should be provided by  account owner for being liquidated

## Vulnerability Detail
In unhappy flow ` _syncLiquidationFee(remainder - terminationReward);` is called to provide liquidation penalty to tranche and tressury. But in unhappy flow account owner doesn't pay any tokens for his debt. The debt is covered by LP providers. So the liquidation penalty is paid by LP providers in this case


## Impact
LP providers are paying liquidation 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
      uint256 remainder = liquidationPenalty + terminationReward - openDebt;
            if (openDebt >= liquidationPenalty) {
                // "openDebt" is bigger than the "liquidationPenalty" but smaller than the total pending liquidation incentives.
                // Don't pay out the "liquidationPenalty" to Lps, partially pay out the "terminator".
                realisedLiquidityOf[terminator] += remainder;
            } else {
                realisedLiquidityOf[terminator] += terminationReward;
                _syncLiquidationFee(remainder - terminationReward);
            }
            totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + remainder);
