# AbstractStakingAM only supports one reward token

## Summary

`StakingAM` only supports one reward token. If the staking program rewards two or more different tokens, any subsequent reward tokens will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the abstract contract `StakingAM`, `REWARD_TOKEN` is an immutable:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L38

```solidity
ERC20 public immutable REWARD_TOKEN;
```

Furthermore, in the function `claimReward()`, only one reward token is eventually transferred out to the position owner:

```solidity
function claimReward(uint256 positionId) external virtual nonReentrant returns (uint256 rewards) {
    // ...

    // Claim the reward from the external staking contract.
    _claimReward(asset);

    // Pay out the share of the reward owed to the position owner.
    if (rewards > 0) {
        // Transfer reward
        REWARD_TOKEN.safeTransfer(msg.sender, rewards);
        emit RewardPaid(positionId, address(REWARD_TOKEN), uint128(rewards));
    }
}
```

All other reward tokens claimed will be stuck in the contract.

The `StakingAM` is an abstract contract [designed to handle staking positions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L16-L27), therefore it should be able to handle staking positions with multiple rewards. There are many staking programs that rewards stakers with multiple reward tokens. 

## Impact

Incompatibility with staking programs with more than one reward tokens. All subsequent reward tokens will be stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`REWARD_TOKEN` should be a dynamic list or mapping with permissioned listing for reward tokens, or it should at least be a list of tokens upon construction/initialization. Reward handling can either be transferring all rewards out to the owner at `claimReward()`, or make separate functions for AM-claiming, and user-claiming.
