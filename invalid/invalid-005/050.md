# Unsafe casting from `uint256` to `uint8` on the `tranches` array length, causing the emitting of incorrect values

## Summary

The `tranches` length was cast from `uint256` to `uint8`, and the value is emitted as the `tranchIndex`, this will lead to a wrong value being emitted as `tranchIndex` when the length of tranches exceeds 255.

## Vulnerability Detail

The maximum value for `uint8` is 255, and `uint256` is way bigger, the length of an array is a `uint256` value, and in the code, the length of the `tranches` array was cast to `uint8`, this is an issue because the `tranches` array can grow above 255 in length, this will cause the protocol to emit wrong `tranchIndex`
E.g
When the `tranches` array length is 256 the `tranchIndex` would be 0
When it is 257 the `tranchIndex` would be 1 and so on.

## Impact

Emission of the wrong tranchIndex on-chain, thereby feeding indexers with wrong data

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L216C1-L229C6

```solidity
    function addTranche(address tranche, uint16 interestWeight_) external onlyOwner processInterests {
        if (auctionsInProgress > 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.AuctionOngoing();
        if (isTranche[tranche]) revert LendingPoolErrors.TrancheAlreadyExists();

        totalInterestWeight += interestWeight_;
        interestWeightTranches.push(interestWeight_);
        interestWeight[tranche] = interestWeight_;

@>   uint8 trancheIndex = uint8(tranches.length);
        tranches.push(tranche);
        isTranche[tranche] = true;

        emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(tranche, trancheIndex, interestWeight_);
    }
```

## POC
This is a simple proof of concept, here the true `trancheIndex` was 256 but, it emitted 0,
add this code to 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/test/fuzz/LendingPool/Constructor.fuzz.t.sol
and run it with the command below

```bash
    forge test --mt "testFuzz_poc_tranche_Casting"
```

```solidity
    function testFuzz_poc_tranche_Casting(uint256 vas) public {
        vm.startPrank(users.creatorAddress);
        for (uint i = 1; i <= 256; i++) {
            address _tranche = address(new TrancheExtension(address(pool), vas, "Tranche", "T"));
            vm.expectEmit();
            emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(_tranche, uint8(i), 0);
            pool.addTranche(_tranche, 0);
        }
        // The protocol will emit 0 as tranche index instead of 256 
        address _tranche = address(new TrancheExtension(address(pool), vas, "Tranche", "T"));
        vm.expectEmit();
        emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(_tranche, 0, 0);
        pool.addTranche(_tranche, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();
 
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review and Foundry

## Recommendation
Do not cast the `tranches`  length to `uint8`, and make the following modification to the codebase

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L143

```diff
-    event InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(address indexed tranche, uint8 indexed trancheIndex, uint16 interestWeight);
+    event InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(address indexed tranche, uint indexed trancheIndex, uint16 interestWeight);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L224C9-L224C53

```diff
-    uint8 trancheIndex = uint8(tranches.length);
+    uint trancheIndex = tranches.length;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L244

```diff
-     emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(tranche, uint8(index), interestWeight_);
+    emit InterestWeightTrancheUpdated(tranche, index, interestWeight_);

```


Or put a cap on the length of the `tranches` array that can be added, so that it doesn't exceed `255` which is the maximum value for `uint8`
