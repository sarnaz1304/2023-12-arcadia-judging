# Same Oracle can be added mutiple times thereby give Room for Price Manipulation

## Summary
Same Oracle can be added mutiple times thereby give Room for Price Manipulation in the Registry.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Adds a new oracle to the Registry.
     * @return oracleId Unique identifier of the oracle.
     */
    function addOracle() external onlyOracleModule returns (uint256 oracleId) {
        // Get next id.
        oracleId = oracleCounter;

        unchecked {
            ++oracleCounter;
        }

>>>        emit OracleAdded(oracleId, oracleToOracleModule[oracleId] = msg.sender);
    }
```
The addOracle(...) function above in the Registry contract shows how new Oracle modules are added to the data of oracleToOracleModules, the problem is that no confirmation is present to prevent multiple addition of duplicate Oracle address this could Influence price value from majority power from this duplicate address, the address should only be updated once
## Impact
Same Oracle can be added mutiple times thereby give Room for Price Manipulation in the Registry.sol contract

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Arcadia protocol should ensure a look through of oracleToOracleModule before a new one is added to avoid duplicates.
