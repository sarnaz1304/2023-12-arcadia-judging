# Users in the 2nd most junior tranche can avoid losses created from bad debt

## Summary
Users in the 2nd most junior tranche can avoid losses created from bad debt

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever bad debt is created, it lowers the share value in the most junior tranche. That's why when there's an ongoing auction, deposits and withdraws within the most junior tranche are not possible. However, whenever there's insufficient liquidity to cover for the bad debt in the most junior tranche, it goes onto the next one, lowering its share value too. 

```solidity
    function _processDefault(uint256 badDebt) internal {
        address tranche;
        uint256 maxBurnable;
        uint256 length = tranches.length;
        for (uint256 i = length; i > 0;) {
            unchecked {
                --i;
            }
            tranche = tranches[i];
            maxBurnable = realisedLiquidityOf[tranche];
            if (badDebt < maxBurnable) {
                // Deduct badDebt from the balance of the most junior Tranche.
                unchecked {
                    realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] -= badDebt;
                }
                break;
            } else {
                // Unhappy flow, should never occur in practice!
                // badDebt is bigger than the balance of most junior Tranche -> tranche is completely wiped out
                // and temporarily locked (no new deposits or withdraws possible).
                // DAO or insurance might refund (Part of) the losses, and add Tranche back.
                realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] = 0;
                _popTranche(i, tranche);
                unchecked {
                    badDebt -= maxBurnable;
                }
                ITranche(tranche).lock();
                // Hook to the new most junior Tranche to inform that auctions are ongoing.
                if (i != 0) ITranche(tranches[i - 1]).setAuctionInProgress(true);
            }
        }
    }
```

This would mean that users who are in the 2nd most junior tranche can front-run the bad debt creating tx and avoid losses (which other liquidity providers would experience).

Consider the following scenario: 
1. There's 2 tranches, first one has 500 USDC, second one has 100 USDC, both have a share/asset ratio of 1:1 
2. The first tranche has 2 liquidity providers with equal liquidity in it - 250 USDC
3. User is about to get liquidated, creating bad debt of 200 USDC 
4. One of the Liquidity providers removes all of their 250 USDC from the tranche
5. As the most junior tranche has only 100 USDC, it cannot cover all the bad debt created and is popped. The next 100 USDC are taken as bad debt from the other tranche. As it now has only one liquidity provider, they have to cover all the losses.
6. Although both people had staked an equal amount of USDC for an equal amount of time, because one of them was monitoring transaction, they managed to get out of it and avoid losses. In the end one has 250 USDC and the other one has 150 USDC worth of shares
