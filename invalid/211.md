# Inflexible Asset and Oracle Module Management

## Summary
The `Registry` contract provides functions to add Asset and Oracle modules, crucial for managing assets and oracles within the system. However, it lacks corresponding mechanisms to remove or update existing modules. This oversight restricts the system's ability to adapt to evolving requirements or to respond to discovered vulnerabilities within modules.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract includes `addAssetModule` and `addOracleModule` functions for registering new modules, each performing a check to prevent duplicate entries. Despite this, the absence of functionality for module removal or updates means that once a module is added, it cannot be replaced or unregistered without deploying a new `Registry` contract. This limitation could hinder the system's response to security incidents or the integration of improved module implementations.

```solidity
function addAssetModule(address assetModule) external onlyOwner {
    if (isAssetModule[assetModule]) revert RegistryErrors.AssetModNotUnique();
    isAssetModule[assetModule] = true;
    ...
}

function addOracleModule(address oracleModule) external onlyOwner {
    if (isOracleModule[oracleModule]) revert RegistryErrors.OracleModNotUnique();
    isOracleModule[oracleModule] = true;
    ...
}
```

## Impact
The inability to update or remove asset and oracle modules dynamically could lead to potential security risks if vulnerabilities are discovered in the deployed modules. It also limits the system's flexibility, potentially affecting its capability to adapt to new market conditions or technological advancements.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce functions for the removal and updating of asset and oracle modules, ensuring these operations are securely managed, ideally through a multi-signature process or governance mechanism. This enhancement would improve the system's adaptability and resilience by allowing the timely replacement of modules in response to security concerns or the need for functional upgrades.
