# Deployment on L2 will fail since most L2s are currently incompatible with solidity 0.8.20+ (no PUSH0 opcode support yet).

## Summary
Deployment on L2 will fail since most L2s are currently incompatible with solidity 0.8.20+ (no PUSH0 opcode support yet).

## Vulnerability Detail
Most L2s currently do not support PUSH0 opcode, so solidity 0.8.20+ is still not supported. For example, see the documentaiton on Arbitrum support
https://docs.arbitrum.io/for-devs/concepts/differences-between-arbitrum-ethereum/solidity-support


## Impact
Smart contracts will not be able to be deployed on most L2s.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/guardians/LendingPoolGuardian.sol#L5 (applies to all contracts)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Downgrade Solidity version to 0.8.19 for the time-being, while PUSH0 gets supported (Arbitrum announced that it will plan to support soon).
