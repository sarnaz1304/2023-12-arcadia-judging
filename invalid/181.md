# Approval Address can Interact on Behalf of A Creditor Even when The Creditor has not been Set at All

## Summary
Approval Address can Interact on Behalf of A Creditor Even when The Creditor has not been Set
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
...
>>>  * @dev Anyone can set the approved creditor for themselves, this will not impact the current owner of the Account
     * since the combination of "current owner -> approved creditor" is used in authentication checks.
     * This guarantees that when the ownership of the Account is transferred, the approved Creditor of the old owner has no
     * impact on the new owner. But the new owner can still remove any existing approved Creditors before the transfer.
     */
 function setApprovedCreditor(address creditor_) external {
        approvedCreditor[msg.sender] = creditor_;
    }
```
The comment description in the code provided above shows that indeed any one can set or approve a creditor to msg.sensder, that would not be a problem if this approved address cannot interact with the contract when no creditor has not been set at all, that is the problem that can be noted at  [flashAction(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/accounts/AccountV1.sol#L623) function in the AccountV1.sol contract, The address can call this function and interact with it when there is no Creditor present yet to take charge of the contract functionalities, this is totally wrong and should be corrected by the arcadia protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A necessary validation should be added to the setApprovedCreditor(...) function as provided below to ensure that an approval can only be given when there is a valid Creditor.
```solidity
 function setApprovedCreditor(address creditor_) external {
+++ require ( creditor != address(0) ,  "Error message" )
        approvedCreditor[msg.sender] = creditor_;
    }
```
