# Dos due to Absence of Unblocked Functionality for Blocked Account Version

## Summary
Denial of Service due to Absence of Unblocked Functionality for Blocked Account Version in the Factory.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function blockAccountVersion(uint256 version) external onlyOwner {
        if (version == 0 || version > latestAccountVersion) revert FactoryErrors.InvalidAccountVersion();
        accountVersionBlocked[version] = true;

        // unsafe cast: accountVersion <= latestAccountVersion, which is a uint88.
        emit AccountVersionBlocked(uint88(version));
    }

```
The code above shows how blockAccountVersion(...)  Function is impemented in the Factory contract, the problem is that only Block functionality is present in the contract, in a situation this values are needed for reused latter in the contract, there is no unblock function to reverse this sensitive changes thereby causing denial of service as this is not reversible, and therefore a parmanent problem

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Arcadia Protocol should ensure an Unblock functionality is added to the factory contract to prevent denial of service in situation blocked version are need for reuse in code execution
