# No ability to withdraw from stargate LPStaking in case of emergency

## Summary
No ability to withdraw from stargate LPStaking in case of emergency as `emergencyWithdraw` is not integrated.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can wrap their stargate lp tokens to the AbstractStakingAM contract to use it as collateral in the accounts.

Stargate LPStaking contract [has `emergencyWithdraw` function](https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate/blob/main/contracts/LPStaking.sol#L184-L193) that allows to withdraw lp tokens from contract in case of emergency. In this case there will be no claiming of rewards, just transferring of lp tokens.

But AbstractStakingAM doesn't have integration with that function which takes user's lp token under a risk.
## Impact
No ability to withdraw in case of emergency is stargate
