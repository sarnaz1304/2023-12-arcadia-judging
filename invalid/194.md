# Unintended Emission in LendingPool Contract

## Summary

The Withdraw event is emitted in the contract without being properly initiated in the codebase.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Withdraw event is being emitted without being properly initiated within the codebase. This inconsistency could lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.

## Impact

The emission of the Withdraw event without its declaration in the contract or its inherited contracts could lead to compilation errors during contract deployment or execution. This issue may result in deployment failures or unexpected behavior, compromising the reliability and security of the contract. The absence of proper event declaration could impede contract functionality and integrity, potentially leading to disruptions in the system's operation.

Including this information in the impact section helps stakeholders understand the potential consequences of the issue and underscores the importance of addressing it promptly.
