# Accounting after successful liquidation is broken

## Summary
Accounting after successful liquidation is broken

## Vulnerability Detail
When `startLiquidation` is called upon a user,  their debt is increased by `initiationReward + liquidationPenalty + terminationReward`. However, the `totalLiquidity` is increased only by the `initiationReward`.

```solidity
        (uint256 initiationReward, uint256 terminationReward, uint256 liquidationPenalty) =
            _calculateRewards(startDebt, minimumMargin_);

        // Mint the liquidation incentives as extra debt towards the Account.
        _deposit(initiationReward + liquidationPenalty + terminationReward, msg.sender);

        // Increase the realised liquidity for the initiator.
        // The other incentives will only be added as realised liquidity for the respective actors
        // after the auction is finished.
        realisedLiquidityOf[initiator] += initiationReward;
        totalRealisedLiquidity = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + initiationReward);
```
This first creates the following problem - it unfairly increases the debt, without properly increasing the totalLiquidity, resulting in an inaccurate utilisation rate, which on its own results in higher interest rates for all borrowers.

Note that upon simply `repaying` the debt, the `totalLiquidity` will still not be properly adjusted.
Its amount is adjusted within `_settleLiquidationHappyFlow`.
```solidity
        totalRealisedLiquidity =
            SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(totalRealisedLiquidity + terminationReward + liquidationPenalty + surplus);
```
However, simply adding the same `terminationReward` and `liquidationPenalty` will not properly fix the accounting, as these amounts have been also accruing additional debt on top of them. 
These funds will be retrievable (by the `skim` function), but this will only send them to the treasury, instead of towards the liquidity providers.

## Impact
Wrong accounting, loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Upon `startLiquidation`, also increase the `totalLiquidity` by `terminationReward + liquidationPenalty` in order to have properly calculated utilization rate. If unhappy flow is reached, remove these values accordingly.
