# Insufficient Allowance Check in flashAction Function in LendingPool.sol

## Summary
The flashAction function only enforces a maximum allowance check for non-account owners. This means an attacker with a maximum allowance, even if not an authorized beneficiary, could potentially exploit the function for unauthorized access and actions.


## Vulnerability Detail
- Incomplete Allowance Check: The code assumes that a maximum allowance guarantees authorized access for non-owners. However, this only applies to functions specifically related to managing account permissions like accountManagementAction().
- Potential Attack Scenario: A malicious actor could obtain a maximum allowance from an account owner. This would allow them to call flashAction, potentially perform unauthorized actions with borrowed funds (e.g., transferring them to their own address), and return them before the allowance check triggers.

```solidity
function flashAction(
    // ... other parameters
) external {
    address accountOwner = IFactory(ACCOUNT_FACTORY).ownerOfAccount(account);
    if (accountOwner == address(0)) revert LendingPoolErrors.IsNotAnAccount();

    // Only checks allowance for non-owners (incomplete)
    if (accountOwner != msg.sender) {
        if (creditAllowance[account][accountOwner][msg.sender] != type(uint256).max) {
            revert LendingPoolErrors.Unauthorized();
        }
    }

    // ... rest of the function
}
```



## Impact
- Unauthorized access to and control over the victim's account assets.
- Loss of funds through fraudulent activity.
- Damage to the victim's financial standing and reputation

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce Allowance Check for All Callers:
- Regardless of the caller (owner or not), verify if they have a specific allowance granted by the account owner for calling flashAction.
This can be achieved by introducing a dedicated allowance type or using a role-based access control system.
