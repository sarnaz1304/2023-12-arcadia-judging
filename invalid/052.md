# skim can be called during an ongoing auction.

## Summary
AccountV1.skim function can be called during an ongoing function, since it lacks the ``notDuringAuction`` modifier while calling skim function which is responsible for function to stop executing during an ongoing auction.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calling skim function during an on going auction can disrupt the contract state for eg.  If the skim function is called with a type_ of 0, 1, or 2, it will attempt to transfer tokens from the contract to the caller's address. This could disrupt the auction process if the tokens are supposed to remain in the contract until the auction is completed and if the skim function is called during an auction, it could lead to inconsistencies in the contract's state. For example, the auction is based on the balance of certain tokens, transferring tokens out of the contract could affect the auction's outcome. Like affecting the balance of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token, which can ultimately affect contract state in proportion to the actual balance of the tokens.

## Impact
calling skim during an ongoing auction might possibly disrupt the auction's outcome by altering the balance of tokens within the contract, which could affect the selling price or availability of tokens. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function skim(address token, uint256 id, uint256 type_) public onlyOwner nonReentrant updateActionTimestamp {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add ``notDuringAuction`` to prevent calling skim function during on going auction.
```diff
-   function skim(address token, uint256 id, uint256 type_) public onlyOwner nonReentrant updateActionTimestamp {
+    function skim(address token, uint256 id, uint256 type_) public onlyOwner nonReentrant updateActionTimestamp notDuringAuction {

```
