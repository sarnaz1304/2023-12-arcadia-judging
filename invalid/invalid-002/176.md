# Denial of Service When the Excess Value of from DeltaAsset is enough to handle Subsequent Asset exposure

## Summary
Denial of Service When the Excess Value of from DeltaAsset is enough to handle Subsequent Asset exposure in the AbstractDerivedAM.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function _getAndUpdateExposureAsset(address creditor, bytes32 assetKey, int256 deltaAsset)
        internal
        returns (uint256 exposureAsset)
    {
        // Update exposureAssetLast.
        if (deltaAsset > 0) {
            exposureAsset = lastExposuresAsset[creditor][assetKey].lastExposureAsset + uint256(deltaAsset);
        } else {
            uint256 exposureAssetLast = lastExposuresAsset[creditor][assetKey].lastExposureAsset;
   >>>         exposureAsset = exposureAssetLast > uint256(-deltaAsset) ? exposureAssetLast - uint256(-deltaAsset) : 0;
        }
>>>        lastExposuresAsset[creditor][assetKey].lastExposureAsset = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo112(exposureAsset);
    }
```
The code noted above shows how asset exposure is gotten and handled through the _getAndUpdateExposureAsset(...) function, the point of interest as noted in the code above is the interaction between exposureAssetLast and negative multiplier of deltaAsset, whenever exposureAssetLast is greater than uint256(-deltaAsset) , exposureAssetLast is reduced by the value of deltaAsset and updated to lastExposuresAsset which would then be used for the next interaction and exposure, The problem is that when ever -deltaAsset is greater than exposureAssetLast, lastExposuresAsset is simply updated to zero, the excess value is not accounted for and would be simply lost to the contract, this excess value would have handled the subsequent exposure instead it is completely lost in the AbstractDerivedAM.sol contract
```solidity
   // Struct with the exposures of a specific asset for a specific Creditor.
    struct ExposuresPerAsset {
        // The amount of exposure of the Creditor to the asset at the last interaction.
        uint112 lastExposureAsset;
        // The exposure in USD of the Creditor to the asset at the last interaction, 18 decimals precision.
        uint112 lastUsdExposureAsset;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One way is for the Protocol to consider Using int instead of Uint for lastExposureAsset and other related variable to avoid completely lossing asset variable that could handle asset exposure during subsequent code execution in the AbstractDerivedAM.sol contract
