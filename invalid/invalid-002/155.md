# The current interest is not included in the used margin calculation.

## Summary
We process `interests` before executing some `actions` in the `Lending Pool` to apply unrealized `debt`. 
However, the `used margin` calculation doesn't consider the unrealized `debt`.
As a result, an `account` that can actually be `liquidated` may be marked as `healthy`.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an `account` is `liquidatable`, someone initiates `liquidation`. 
This imposes additional `debt` on the `account`, including `initiation rewards`, `termination rewards`, etc.
```solidity
function startLiquidation(address initiator, uint256 minimumMargin_) {
    (uint256 initiationReward, uint256 terminationReward, uint256 liquidationPenalty) =
        _calculateRewards(startDebt, minimumMargin_);

    // Mint the liquidation incentives as extra debt towards the Account.
    _deposit(initiationReward + liquidationPenalty + terminationReward, msg.sender);
}
```
After some time, the `collateral` value increases due to market conditions.

Anyone can settle the `auction` for this `account`.
```solidity
function _settleAuction(address account, AuctionInformation storage auctionInformation_) {
    uint256 collateralValue = IAccount(account).getCollateralValue();
    uint256 usedMargin = IAccount(account).getUsedMargin();

    if (collateralValue >= usedMargin || usedMargin == minimumMargin) {
        ILendingPool(creditor).settleLiquidationHappyFlow(account, startDebt, minimumMargin, msg.sender);
    }
}
```
Here, `getUsedMargin()` doesn't consider unrealized `debt`, so the `collateral` value may fall between the `getUsedMargin()` value and the `actual used margin`.
This implies that the `auction` of this `account` can be concluded, and someone can initiate `liquidation` for this `account` again immediately.
## Impact
This incurs additional `debt` to the `accounts` and is unfair.

## Recommendation
The `getUsedMargin` calculation should also include unrealized `debt`.
