# Old Owner can take Advantage of updateActionTimestamp Modifier Absence to Front RunAccountV1 contract Against New Owner

## Summary
Old Owner can take Advantage of updateActionTimestamp Modifier Absence to front Run closeMarginAccount(...) function call againt Against New Owner
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   /**
     * @dev Starts the cool-down period during which ownership cannot be transferred.
     * This prevents the old Owner from frontrunning a transferFrom().
     */
    modifier updateActionTimestamp() {
        lastActionTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
        _;
    }
```
The modifier provided above shows how updateActionTimestamp is handles, it can be noted in the comment description that oldowner can take advantage of New Owner  though Front Running, which is why this modifier is present in many part of the contract by different function calls however the problem is that this modifier is absent in the closeMarginAccount(...) function call which can be taken advantage of by a bad actor in other to create discrepancies for the new owner immediately after transfer of ownership
```solidity
 function closeMarginAccount() external onlyOwner nonReentrant notDuringAuction {
        // Cache creditor.
        address creditor_ = creditor;
        if (creditor_ == address(0)) revert AccountErrors.CreditorNotSet();

        creditor = address(0);
        liquidator = address(0);
        minimumMargin = 0;

        // Remove the exposures of the Account for the old Creditor.
        (address[] memory assetAddresses, uint256[] memory assetIds, uint256[] memory assetAmounts) =
            generateAssetData();
        IRegistry(registry).batchProcessWithdrawal(creditor_, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);

        // closeMarginAccount() checks if there is still an open position (open liabilities) for the Account.
        // If so, the function reverts.
        ICreditor(creditor_).closeMarginAccount(address(this));

        emit MarginAccountChanged(address(0), address(0));
    }
```
```solidity
  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) external onlyFactory notDuringAuction {
        if (block.timestamp <= lastActionTimestamp + COOL_DOWN_PERIOD) revert AccountErrors.CoolDownPeriodNotPassed();

        // The Factory will check that the new owner is not address(0).
        owner = newOwner;
    }
```
## Impact
Old Owner can Manipulate contract through Frontrunning

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The modifer should be added to the closeMarginAccount() function as provided below
```solidity
---  function closeMarginAccount() external onlyOwner nonReentrant notDuringAuction {
+++  function closeMarginAccount() external onlyOwner nonReentrant notDuringAuction updateActionTimestamp {
        // Cache creditor.
        address creditor_ = creditor;
        if (creditor_ == address(0)) revert AccountErrors.CreditorNotSet();

        creditor = address(0);
        liquidator = address(0);
        minimumMargin = 0;

        // Remove the exposures of the Account for the old Creditor.
        (address[] memory assetAddresses, uint256[] memory assetIds, uint256[] memory assetAmounts) =
            generateAssetData();
        IRegistry(registry).batchProcessWithdrawal(creditor_, assetAddresses, assetIds, assetAmounts);

        // closeMarginAccount() checks if there is still an open position (open liabilities) for the Account.
        // If so, the function reverts.
        ICreditor(creditor_).closeMarginAccount(address(this));

        emit MarginAccountChanged(address(0), address(0));
    }
```
