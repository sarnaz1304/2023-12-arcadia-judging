# Blocked Accounts are not Checked before Transfer to New Innocent Users

## Summary
Blocked Account are not Checked before Transfer to Innocent New Users
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function blockAccountVersion(uint256 version) external onlyOwner {
        if (version == 0 || version > latestAccountVersion) revert FactoryErrors.InvalidAccountVersion();
 >>>       accountVersionBlocked[version] = true;

        // unsafe cast: accountVersion <= latestAccountVersion, which is a uint88.
        emit AccountVersionBlocked(uint88(version));
    }
```
The code above from the factory contract shows the blockAccountVersion(...) function and how it is Implemented, it can be noted from the pointer how Blocked account Versions are set to true, but the problem is that none of this factors is put into consideration during account transfer to a new User as provided below from the same contract, this can be used to take advantage of innocent users who get this block data transfered to them with restrictions that affect flow of code execution 
```solidity
function safeTransferAccount(address to) public {
        if (to == address(0)) revert FactoryErrors.InvalidRecipient();

        uint256 id = accountIndex[msg.sender];
        if (id == 0) revert FactoryErrors.OnlyAccount();

        address from = _ownerOf[id];

        // Underflow of the sender's balance is impossible because we check for
        // ownership above and the recipient's balance can't realistically overflow.
        unchecked {
            _balanceOf[from]--;
            _balanceOf[to]++;
        }

        _ownerOf[id] = to;

        delete getApproved[id];

        if (
            to.code.length != 0
                && ERC721TokenReceiver(to).onERC721Received(msg.sender, from, id, "")
                    != ERC721TokenReceiver.onERC721Received.selector
        ) revert FactoryErrors.UnsafeRecipient();

        emit Transfer(from, to, id);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Arcadia Protocol should ensure necessary validation dis done to prevent transfer of already blocked account to new users I  the Factory Contract
