# `AbstractAM._getKeyFromAsset` is vulnerable to collision

## Summary
`AbstractAM._getKeyFromAsset` return the OR operation over 2 values, but there can be multiple 2-values couples that lead to the same key.

## Vulnerability Detail
The OR function is not safe as there are a lot of potential of collision, as for two chosen number A and B, there are many couple (X,Y) such as OR(A,B) = OR(X,Y)
This means a user could deposit a totally crafted asset (for example deploying its own ERC721/ERC1155), where the key ( maliciousAssetAddress, maliciousAssetId) will match a real key which is way more valuable and not his own.

```solidity
    function _getKeyFromAsset(address asset, uint256 assetId) internal view virtual returns (bytes32 key) {
        assembly {
            // Shift the assetId to the left by 20 bytes (160 bits).
            // Then OR the result with the address.
            key := or(shl(160, assetId), asset) 
        }										
    }
```

## Impact
User can borrow assets to a Creditor with no real collateral value

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _getKeyFromAsset(address asset, uint256 assetId) internal view virtual returns (bytes32 key) {
        assembly {
            // Shift the assetId to the left by 20 bytes (160 bits).
            // Then OR the result with the address.
            key := or(shl(160, assetId), asset) 
        }										
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than using OR, hash both values using `keccak256`
