# Guardian may not be able to `pause` the protocol under certain conditions.

## Summary
Guardian may not be able to `pause` the protocol under certain conditions. To be precise, these are some of the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1:
1. At day 0, Guardian paused the protocol to investigate any issues.
2. Quickly after the guardian resolved the issues, the Owner unpaused the protocol.
3. Now, between day 0 to 32, the guardian can no longer pause the protocol the second time.

Scenario 2:
1. At day 0, Guardian paused the protocol.
4. At day 30, someone calls `unpause` public function to allow repay, withdraw, and liquidation.
5. Now, if unexpected event happens between day 30 to 32, the guardian can no longer pause the protocol again.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `pause` function by the owner can only pause once every 32 days. When the `pause` is called, `pauseTimestamp` is updated to the block timestamp at execution.

However, there are 2 ways to unpause:
1. Guardian unpause -- this simply tries to unpause, but does not reset the cooldown.
2. Public unpause -- this can only be called after day +30.

However, none of unpauses actually resets the `pauseTimestamp`. This means that after the first pause, the second pause can only happen 32 days+ after. But in fact, it is possible that the guardian may need to pause the protocols more than 1 time in the 32 day duration (see example scenarios above).

## Impact
Guardian may not be able to `pause` the protocol when they want to.

## Recommendation
- Consider resetting `pauseTimestamp` when unpause. This, however, may add other complications.
