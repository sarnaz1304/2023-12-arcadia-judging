# 0xDazai - Inflation attack vector duo to missing zero check for VAS value

### Inflation attack vector duo to missing zero check for VAS value

Medium

## Summary

The Tranche.sol smart contract is responsible for managing the account balances of Liquidity Providers. 

The VAS variable is immutable and is established during contract creation via the constructor. It serves as a safeguard against inflationary attacks on ERC4626 vaults by representing virtual shares. 

## Vulnerability Detail

However the contract lacks a validation check to ensure that the VAS is not initialized to zero. If the VAS is set to zero upon contract deployment, it would be irrevocable, and this vulnerability could potentially be exploited by a malicious actor to launch an inflation attack. It is important to note that the integrity of most functions within the contract is contingent upon the value of the VAS variable. Therefore, it is imperative to implement a validation mechanism to prevent the VAS from being initialized to zero, thereby mitigating the risk of such an attack vector.

## Impact

If VAS value is set to zero malicous user can create inflation attack by being the first user who deposits.

```solidity
    constructor(address lendingPool_, uint256 vas, string memory prefix_, string memory prefixSymbol_)
        ERC4626(
            ERC4626(address(lendingPool_)).asset(),
            string(abi.encodePacked(prefix_, " ArcadiaV2 ", ERC4626(lendingPool_).asset().name())),
            string(abi.encodePacked(prefixSymbol_, "arcV2", ERC4626(lendingPool_).asset().symbol()))
        )
        Owned(msg.sender)
    {
        LENDING_POOL = ILendingPool(lendingPool_);
        VAS = vas;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To resolve the issue of the VAS (Virtual Assets and Shares) being potentially initialized to zero, which could lead to an inflation attack, you should add a validation check in the constructor of the `Tranche` contract to ensure that the VAS value is greater than zero. This check will prevent the contract from being deployed with a VAS value that could compromise the security of the contract.

Here is the recommended change to the constructor:

```diff
constructor(
address lendingPool_,
uint256 vas,
string memory prefix_,
string memory prefixSymbol_
)
ERC4626(
ERC4626(address(lendingPool_)).asset(),
string(abi.encodePacked(prefix_, " ArcadiaV2 ", ERC4626(lendingPool_).asset().name())),
string(abi.encodePacked(prefixSymbol_, "arcV2", ERC4626(lendingPool_).asset().symbol()))
)
Owned(msg.sender)
{
+ require(vas > 0, "VAS must be greater than 0"); // Add this line to ensure VAS is greater than zero
LENDING_POOL = ILendingPool(lendingPool_);
VAS = vas;
}
```
