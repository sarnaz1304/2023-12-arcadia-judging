# Lack of `checkOracleSequence` call in function `Registry::getRateInUsd`

## Summary
The `checkOracleSequence` ensures that the oracle sequence should comply with sets of criteria(For example, properly added oracle, consecutive order, last Asset being USD). However, in `Registry::getRateInUsd`, `oracleSequence` is being directly unpacked and used without calling `checkOracleSequence`. Thus, the input `oracle` may not be registered, the sequence may not be valid, and even the last asset may not be `USD`, all leading to an incorrect return value of `rate`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [Registry::getRateInUsd](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L580-L600) is external and can be called by anyone including users.

```solidity
    function getRateInUsd(bytes32 oracleSequence) external view returns (uint256 rate) {
        (bool[] memory baseToQuoteAsset, uint256[] memory oracles) = oracleSequence.unpack();

        rate = 1e18;

        uint256 length = oracles.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
            // Each Oracle has a fixed base asset and quote asset.
            // The oracle-rate expresses how much tokens of the quote asset (18 decimals precision) are required
            // to buy 1 token of the BaseAsset.
            if (baseToQuoteAsset[i]) {
                // "Normal direction" (how much of the QuoteAsset is required to buy 1 token of the BaseAsset).
                // -> Multiply with the oracle-rate.
                rate = rate.mulDivDown(IOracleModule(oracleToOracleModule[oracles[i]]).getRate(oracles[i]), 1e18);
            } else {
                // "Inverse direction" (how much of the BaseAsset is required to buy 1 token of the QuoteAsset).
                // -> Divide by the oracle-rate.
                rate = rate.mulDivDown(1e18, IOracleModule(oracleToOracleModule[oracles[i]]).getRate(oracles[i]));
            }
        }
    }
```
However, the function doesn't call `checkOracleSequence` to perform the [check to ensure the following criteria](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L280-L284):
- The oracle must be previously added to the Registry and must still be active.
- The last Asset of oracles (except for the last oracle) must be equal to the first asset of the next oracle.
- The last Asset of the last oracle must be USD.
 
The function just unpacks the `oracleSequence` and does the multiply without checking and reverting. If any of the above criteria is not met, the returned value will be incorrect. Thus, the input `oracle` may not be registered, the sequence may not be valid, and even the last asset may not be `USD`, all leading to an incorrect return value of `rate`.

## Impact
`Registry::getRateInUsd` can be called by anyone but it lacks a check of the input `oracleSequence`. Thus, the input `oracle` may not be registered, the sequence may not be valid, and even the last asset may not be `USD`, all leading to an incorrect return value of `rate`.

        uint256 length = oracles.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
            // Each Oracle has a fixed base asset and quote asset.
            // The oracle-rate expresses how much tokens of the quote asset (18 decimals precision) are required
            // to buy 1 token of the BaseAsset.
            if (baseToQuoteAsset[i]) {
                // "Normal direction" (how much of the QuoteAsset is required to buy 1 token of the BaseAsset).
                // -> Multiply with the oracle-rate.
                rate = rate.mulDivDown(IOracleModule(oracleToOracleModule[oracles[i]]).getRate(oracles[i]), 1e18);
            } else {
                // "Inverse direction" (how much of the BaseAsset is required to buy 1 token of the QuoteAsset).
                // -> Divide by the oracle-rate.
                rate = rate.mulDivDown(1e18, IOracleModule(oracleToOracleModule[oracles[i]]).getRate(oracles[i]));
            }
        }
    }
```

[Registry::checkOracleSequence](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Registry.sol#L280-L284)

```solidity
     * - The oracle must be previously added to the Registry and must still be active.
     * - The last Asset of oracles (except for the last oracle) must be equal to the first asset of the next oracle.
     * - The last Asset of the last oracle must be USD.
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, VSCode

## Recommendation
Add `require(checkOracleSequence(oracleSequence),"bad oracle sequence");` in the function to ensure the input is checked by default.
