# StakedStargateAM.sol The approve() return value not checked

## Summary
There is no checking of return value when calling `approve()` in `_stake()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Not all IERC20 implementations revert when there's a failure in approve.
Some ERC-20 tokens, such as USDC (USD Coin), are known to exhibit behavior where the approve function does not revert on failure.
The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead

## Impact
By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything.
