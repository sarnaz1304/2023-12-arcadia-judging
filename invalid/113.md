# There is no deviation check between current sqrtP of pool and sqrtP which is calculated from usd rates.

## Summary
The `sqrtP` calculated from usd rates can be much different from current pool's `sqrtP`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`UniswapV3AM.sol#_getPrincipalAmounts` function which calculates principal amounts is as follows.
```solidity
    function _getPrincipalAmounts(
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 liquidity,
        uint256 priceToken0,
        uint256 priceToken1
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        // Calculate the square root of the relative rate sqrt(token1/token0) from the trusted USD price of both tokens.
        // sqrtPriceX96 is a binary fixed point number with 96 digits precision.
277     uint160 sqrtPriceX96 = _getSqrtPriceX96(priceToken0, priceToken1);

        // Calculate amount0 and amount1 of the principal (the liquidity position without accumulated fees).
        (amount0, amount1) = LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(
            sqrtPriceX96, TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickLower), TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(tickUpper), liquidity
        );
    }
```
As we can see on L277, it calculates `sqrtP` from usd rates. But this value can be much different from current pool's `sqrtP`. This can leads to unexpected error.

## Impact
The `sqrtP` calculated from usd rates can be much different from current pool's `sqrtP` and in this case it can potentially lead to unexpected error.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We have to add deviation check of current `sqrtP` of pool and `sqrtP` from usd rates.
