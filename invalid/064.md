# `Liquidation#bid` does not check that the account is still liquidatable.

## Summary
`Liquidation#bid` does not check that the account is still liquidatable.

## Vulnerability Detail
After a user has been called `startLiquidation` any user can call `bid` on the account, effectively buying some of their collateral in order to repay part of the debt. 

```solidity
   function bid(address account, uint256[] memory askedAssetAmounts, bool endAuction_) external nonReentrant {
        AuctionInformation storage auctionInformation_ = auctionInformation[account];
        if (!auctionInformation_.inAuction) revert LiquidatorErrors.NotForSale();

        // Calculate the current auction price of the assets being bought.
        uint256 totalShare = _calculateTotalShare(auctionInformation_, askedAssetAmounts);
        uint256 price = _calculateBidPrice(auctionInformation_, totalShare);

        // Transfer an amount of "price" in "Numeraire" to the LendingPool to repay the Accounts debt.
        // The LendingPool will call a "transferFrom" from the bidder to the pool -> the bidder must approve the LendingPool.
        // If the amount transferred would exceed the debt, the surplus is paid out to the Account Owner and earlyTerminate is True.
        uint128 startDebt = auctionInformation_.startDebt;
        bool earlyTerminate = ILendingPool(auctionInformation_.creditor).auctionRepay(
            startDebt, auctionInformation_.minimumMargin, price, account, msg.sender
        );

        // Transfer the assets to the bidder.
        IAccount(account).auctionBid(
            auctionInformation_.assetAddresses, auctionInformation_.assetIds, askedAssetAmounts, msg.sender
        );

        // If all the debt is repaid, the auction must be ended, even if the bidder did not set endAuction to true.
        if (earlyTerminate) {
            // Stop the auction, no need to do a health check for the account since it has no debt anymore.
            _endAuction(account);
        }
        // If not all debt is repaid, the bidder can still earn a termination incentive by ending the auction
        // if one of the conditions to end the auction is met.
        // "_endAuction()" will silently fail without reverting, if the auction was not successfully ended.
        else if (endAuction_) {
            if (_settleAuction(account, auctionInformation_)) _endAuction(account);
        }
    }
```

However, there lacks a check that the account is still liquidatable. 
This would allow for unfair liquidation in multiple scenarios, one such including: 
1. User A becomes liquidatable.
2. User B calls `startLiquidation` on user A 
3. User A's collateral goes back up in value, getting to a point where the account is healthy.
4. User C can still call `bid` and liquidate user A, despite their account being in a healthy position.

## Impact

## Recommendation
When `bid` is called, check if the account is unhealthy first.
