# `StakedStargateAM` won't work on some L2 chains

## Summary
The `StakedStargateAM` contract won't work on some L2 chains, as on some of those, there are no Chainlink price feeds for the reward tokens of the `LPStakingTime` contract

## Vulnerability Detail
As it is stated in the contest README, the contracts in scope for this audit are intended to be deployed on all L2 chains: 

On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

- Now: Base
- Future: Optimism, Arbitrum, **other L2s**

However, the `StakedStargateAM` contract will not be able to function properly on all of those. That's because on some of them, there are no Chainlink price feeds for the reward tokens of the `LPStakingTime` contract. This means that on those chains, the price of the reward tokens will not be able to be fetched, leading to the `Regisrty::getCollateralValue` and `Regisrty::getLiquidationValue` not being able to function with the `StakedStargateAM` and in turn, making the protocol unable to function with this particular asset module.

Such is the case on the Linea blockchain. As it can be seen, the [`LPStakingTime`](https://lineascan.build/address/0x4a364f8c717cAAD9A442737Eb7b8A55cc6cf18D8#readContract) contract that is deployed on it has [STG](https://lineascan.build/address/0x808d7c71ad2ba3fa531b068a2417c63106bc0949) set as its reward token. And as it can be seen on the official page for the [STG/USD](https://data.chain.link/feeds/arbitrum/mainnet/stg-usd) price pair on the Chainlink website, there is no Chainlink STG/USD price feed on the Linea chain. In fact, there is no Chainlink price feed for the STG token on that chain at all.

## Impact
The Stargate staking integration will not work on some chains

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an additional Oracle Module that will be able to price the tokens that do not have Chainlink price feeds on some chains
