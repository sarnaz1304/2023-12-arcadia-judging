# createAccount function on Factory contract is calling _mint instead of _safeMInt when minting tokens (nfts)

## Summary
Function createAccount on Factory contract should call _safeMint when minting new accounts of nfts instead of _mint.

## Vulnerability Detail
The usage of _safeMint guarantees that the receiver to address is either a smart contract that implements IERC721Receiver.onERC721Receivedor an EOA.

## Impact
Token (or account) can be stuck on contract that does not implement receiver.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use _safeMint() instead of _mint() for ERC721 minting in createAccount function.
