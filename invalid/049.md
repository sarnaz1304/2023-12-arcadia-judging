# User can loose assets when withdrawing  or redeeming from Tranche.sol

## Summary
When calling withdraw or redeeming in `Tranche.sol`, a user can loose his assets 

## Vulnerability Detail
  User shares are been [burnt before checking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/Tranche.sol#L225) if the assets is <= to his actual shares of the pool. 

This check takes please in `LENDING_POOL.withdrawFromLendingPool` and reverts if [`realisedLiquidityOf[msg.sender] > assets amount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L377)

## Impact

User could permanently loose access to their funds in pool

## Code Snippet

```solidity
   function withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner_)
        public
        override
        notLocked
        notDuringAuction
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        // No need to check for rounding error, previewWithdraw rounds up.
        shares = previewWithdrawAndSync(assets);

        if (msg.sender != owner_) {
            // Saves gas for limited approvals.
            uint256 allowed = allowance[owner_][msg.sender];

            if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[owner_][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
        }

        _burn(owner_, shares); //  <= burn before check

        LENDING_POOL.withdrawFromLendingPool(assets, receiver);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner_, assets, shares);
    }
```

```solidity
  function redeem(uint256 shares, address receiver, address owner_)
        public
        override
        notLocked
        notDuringAuction
        returns (uint256 assets)
    {
        if (msg.sender != owner_) {
            // Saves gas for limited approvals.
            uint256 allowed = allowance[owner_][msg.sender];

            if (allowed != type(uint256).max) allowance[owner_][msg.sender] = allowed - shares;
        }

        // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewRedeem.
        if ((assets = previewRedeemAndSync(shares)) == 0) revert TrancheErrors.ZeroAssets();

        _burn(owner_, shares); // <= burn before check

        LENDING_POOL.withdrawFromLendingPool(assets, receiver);

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, receiver, owner_, assets, shares);
    }
 ```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
