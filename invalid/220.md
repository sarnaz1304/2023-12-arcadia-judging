# Violation of ERC-721 Standard in Factory.sol#tokenURI() implementation.

## Summary
In the Arcadia Protocol, a vulnerability has been identified in the tokenURI method implementation, where the method does not verify if the NFT has been minted before returning data. This oversight allows the method to return data for non-existent NFT IDs, potentially creating fake NFT representations within the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The tokenURI method, as implemented, fails to check whether an NFT has been minted before executing. This lack of validation means that any call to tokenURI with an arbitrary or maliciously chosen NFT ID will still return data, misleading users into believing that the NFT exists within the Arcadia Protocol. This behavior deviates from the expected standard practice, where such a method should validate the existence of an NFT ID before proceeding to return data related to it.

## Impact
- By invoking the [Factory.tokenURI](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/Factory.sol#L335-L337) method for a maliciously provided NFT id, the returned data may deceive potential users, as the method will return data for a non-existent NFT id that appears to be a genuine PrivatePool. This can lead to a poor user experience or financial loss for users.
- Violation of the [ERC721-Metadata part](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) standard
- In scenarios where users make decisions based on the returned data (e.g., trading, purchasing), there is a risk of financial loss due to actions taken on the premise of misleading information.

## Recommendation
Throw an error if the NFT id is invalid.
