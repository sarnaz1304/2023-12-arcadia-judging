# [H-1] - User can crate multiple accounts and use the minted NFTs as collateral

## Summary
A malicious user can create multiple accounts and then deposit all of the minted NFTs into one main margin account and use them as collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
It will essentially be free for the user to create multiple margin accounts by using the `Factory::createAccount()` function. After creating those accounts, they can deposit the minted NFTs into one main margin account and use them as practically free collateral to obtain margin from the creditor.

## Impact
The malicious user can get margin for free, so he doesn't care about being liquidated because they lose nothing. The other created accounts are practically useless, so he doesn't care what happens with them either.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if a user already has an account, and if they do, revert the `Factory::createAccount()` function or make the function payable so that minting multiple accounts does not appear worthwhile.
