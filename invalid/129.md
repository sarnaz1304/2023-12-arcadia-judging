### Use of `slot0` can lead to price manipulation

### High

## Summary

The _getFeeGrowthInside function in the UniswapV3AM contract calculates the fee growth inside a liquidity position's range in a Uniswap V3 pool. It relies on data from the slot0 function of the IUniswapV3Pool interface, which provides the current price (among other data) of the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

The underlying mechanism of the Uniswap V3 pool (i.e., the slot0 function and the tick system) can be influenced by market activities. It's important to note that such manipulation would affect the entire pool and not just this specific contract.

Here's how the `_getFeeGrowthInside` function works:

1. It retrieves the current tick from slot0.
2. It fetches the fee growth outside the range for both the lower and upper ticks of the liquidity position.
3. It calculates the fee growth inside the range based on the current tick and the fee growth outside the range for the position's ticks.

Regarding price manipulation, the slot0 function returns the current state of the pool, which includes the current price, represented as a square root value. This price is determined by the last transaction that occurred in the pool and can be influenced by trading activity. If an malicious actor has enough capital to perform large trades (via flashloan), they could manipulate the price by executing swaps that move the price to a favorable tick.

## Impact

The use of storage slot 0 can be manipulated easily via MEV bots and Flashloans with sandwich attacks.

```solidity
        (, int24 tickCurrent,,,,,) = pool.slot0();

## Recommendation

I recommend the implementation of the Uniswap V3 Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP). It offers robust and reliable mechanisms for obtaining market prices, ensuring the integrity of the contract's operations
