# Chainlink Returns Allow a 0 Price

## Summary
When determining the validity of a Chainlink price, the if statement demands price must be `>=` 0. This statement is ensuring the Chainlink feed is not returning false data in any way, but if it's returning a 0 price it is almost certainly false data.

## Vulnerability Detail
There shouldn't be any situation in a Chainlink feed where a 0 price is valid, and a 0 price would much more likely signify that there's a bug in the system or the feed isn't returning correct data for some reason.

## Impact
If price is falsely returned as 0 the impact could be disastrous and lead to infinite borrowing and large liquidations of an asset, but it's an unlikely scenario this would occur so it's likely a medium impact.

## Code Snippet
`if (
                roundId > 0 && answer_ >= 0 && updatedAt > block.timestamp - oracleInformation_.cutOffTime
                    && updatedAt <= block.timestamp
            ) {
                success = true;
                answer = uint256(answer_);
            }`
