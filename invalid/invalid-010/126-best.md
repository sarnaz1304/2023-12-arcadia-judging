# 0xDazai - If answer returned from `_getRate()` function is `0,`  `getRate()`will return 0 value for price

### If answer returned from _getRate() function is 0, getRate() will return 0 value price

### High

## Summary

`ChainlinkOM.sol` contains an internal function, `_getLatestAnswer`, which is responsible for fetching the latest data from the oracle and performing both sanity and staleness checks. This function is subsequently invoked by the external `getRate` function, which aims to provide the exchange rate of the BaseAsset in terms of the QuoteAsset.

`_getLatestAnswer` validates the oracle's response by verifying that `answer_ >= 0`. This condition considers a zero value as a legitimate response. If all other sanity checks are satisfied and the oracle returns a zero value, the `success` flag is set to `true`, and `answer` is assigned as `uint256(answer_)`.

The `getRate` function then proceeds with these parameters, only processing the rate calculation if `success` is true. It performs an unchecked multiplication: `oracleRate = answer * oracleInformation_.unitCorrection`. If the `answer` is zero, this results in an `oracleRate` price of zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

This behavior poses a risk of incorrect asset pricing, potentially leading to economic vulnerabilities within the protocol. A zero value from the oracle, when propagated through the system, could be misinterpreted as a valid rate, thereby affecting any dependent calculations or operations.

## Impact

If the returned value is 0 it  poses a risk of incorrect asset pricing, potentially leading to economic vulnerabilities within the protocol.

```solidity

        OracleInformation memory oracleInformation_ = oracleInformation[oracleId];


        (bool success, uint256 answer) = _getLatestAnswer(oracleInformation_);


        // If the oracle is not active, the transactions revert.
        // This implies that no new credit can be taken against assets that use the decommissioned oracle,
        // but at the same time positions with these assets cannot be liquidated.
        // A new oracleSequence for these assets must be set ASAP in their Asset Modules by the protocol owner.
        if (!success) revert InactiveOracle();


        // Only overflows at absurdly large rates, when rate > type(uint256).max / 10 ** (18 - decimals).
        // This is 1.1579209e+59 for an oracle with 0 decimals.
        unchecked {
            oracleRate = answer * oracleInformation_.unitCorrection;
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the conditional statement from `answer_ >= 0` to `answer > 0` to ensure that the condition is met only when `answer_` holds a value greater than zero. This adjustment enhances the precision of the contract's logic.
