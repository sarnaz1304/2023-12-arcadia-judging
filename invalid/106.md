# `Registry::_isSequencerDown()` does not set `sequencerDown` to false when oracle call reverts

## Summary
`Registry::_isSequencerDown()` checks if the L2 sequencer is down. However, it can return the wrong flag if the call to `Chainlink::latestRoundData()` happens to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Registry.sol` has the following function for checking whether the L2 sequencer is down:

```solidity
function _isSequencerDown(address creditor) internal view returns (bool success, bool sequencerDown) {
    // This guarantees that no stale oracles are consumed when the sequencer is down,
    // and that Account owners have time (the grace period) to bring their Account back in a healthy state.
    try IChainLinkData(sequencerUptimeOracle).latestRoundData() returns (
        uint80, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, uint256, uint80
    ) {
        success = true;
        if (answer == 1 || block.timestamp - startedAt < riskParams[creditor].gracePeriod) {
            sequencerDown = true;
        }
    } catch { }
}
```

which is then used for the following modifier:

```solidity
modifier sequencerNotDown(address creditor) {
    (, bool sequencerDown) = _isSequencerDown(creditor);
    if (sequencerDown) revert RegistryErrors.SequencerDown();
    _;
}
```

The problem here is that if the call to `latestRoundData()` reverts, `Registry::_isSequencerDown()` will return `success = false` and `sequencerDown = false`. As we can see from the modifier, it only looks at `sequencerDown` to derive the state of the sequencer.

Chainlink oracles can revert for multiple reasons. Chainlink's multisig has the authority to pause/stop oracles at will. A discrepancy with this feed will cause functions dependent on the `sequencerNotDown()` modifier to keep executing with stale data.

## Impact
The following functions from `Registry` are affected:

- `getValuesInUsd()`
- `getValuesInNumeraire()`
- `getTotalValue()`
- `getCollateralValue()`
- `getLiquidationValue()`

The accounts and any other external callers depending on the data of those functions will be receiving potentially stale/incorrect data as the L2 sequencer is down. The most impacted component of the protocol would be the accounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The easiest fix is to set `sequencerDown = true` in the `catch` block.

However, I would personally refactor the code so that it checks if the sequencer is up rather than down. I wound just change the function to `_isSequencerActive()` and the modifier to `sequencerActive()`. Checking for "active" instead of "not down" makes it easier to reason about. If it was done that way in the first place, the mistake would've been avoided as the return value would've been false by default.
