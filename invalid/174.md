# H-1: Liquidation Reverts due Block Gas Limit

## Summary
The `liquidateAccount` function in `Liquidator.sol` may encounter issues when attempting to liquidate accounts with a large number of assets, including ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 tokens. The `liquidateAccount` function calls  `AccountV1.sol::startLiquidation` and it will call  `AccountV1.sol::generateAssetData` and `Registry.sol::getValuesInNumeraire`, which aggregates asset data, and then proceeds to value these assets through a series of calls to oracle modules. This process can consume a significant amount of gas, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing the transaction to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the unbounded loop within the `AccountV1.sol::generateAssetData` , `Registry.sol::getValuesInNumeraire`,`Registry.sol::getValuesInUsd`, `Registry.sol::getRateInUsd` function, which iterates over all assets held by an account. The subsequent valuation process involves multiple external calls to oracle modules for each asset to determine their USD value. As the number of assets increases, the cumulative gas cost of these operations may surpass the block gas limit, leading to transaction failure.

## Impact
If the `liquidateAccount::Liquidator.sol` function fails due to high gas costs, the account in question cannot be liquidated. This failure can result in bad debt within the protocol, as the assets remain unsold and the associated debt remains unpaid. It also prevents liquidators from performing their role, potentially impacting the protocol's stability and trustworthiness

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure compliance with the block gas limit, one approach is to implement a logic revision that mitigates the necessity of iterating over the entire set of existing Assets. Alternatively, constraining the number of Assets within a manageable threshold can prevent exceeding the block gas limit. These strategies aim to optimize efficiency and maintain system integrity within the constraints of blockchain resource limitations.
