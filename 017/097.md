# Possible permanent lock of funds within a certain tranche due to overflow risk

## Summary
Possible permanent lock of funds within a certain tranche due to overflow risk

## Vulnerability Detail
Within every tranche, users are allocated shares which represent a % of the tranche's liquidity within a certain Liquidity Pool. In most scenarios, a share's value will go up, but this is not the case for the last tranche - when bad occurs, it lowers the value of the shares in the last tranche.
```solidity
    function _processDefault(uint256 badDebt) internal {
        address tranche;
        uint256 maxBurnable;
        uint256 length = tranches.length;
        for (uint256 i = length; i > 0;) {
            unchecked {
                --i;
            }
            tranche = tranches[i];
            maxBurnable = realisedLiquidityOf[tranche];
            if (badDebt < maxBurnable) {
                // Deduct badDebt from the balance of the most junior Tranche.
                unchecked {
                    realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] -= badDebt;
                }
                break;
            } else {
                // Unhappy flow, should never occur in practice!
                // badDebt is bigger than the balance of most junior Tranche -> tranche is completely wiped out
                // and temporarily locked (no new deposits or withdraws possible).
                // DAO or insurance might refund (Part of) the losses, and add Tranche back.
                realisedLiquidityOf[tranche] = 0;
                _popTranche(i, tranche);
                unchecked {
                    badDebt -= maxBurnable;
                }
                ITranche(tranche).lock();
                // Hook to the new most junior Tranche to inform that auctions are ongoing.
                if (i != 0) ITranche(tranches[i - 1]).setAuctionInProgress(true);
            }
        }
    }
```

This however, opens up a certain risk. Here's what could happen for a regular token with 18 decimals:
1. Users deposit 100e18 and get minted 100e18 shares.
2. Bad debt occurs and leaves only a dust amount of liquidity for the tranche (e.g. 1 wei)
3. Now the share/ asset ratio is 100e18 : 1. User deposits 100e18 of liquidity and therefore get minted 100e38 shares.
4. Now if once again bad debt occurs and liquidity drops to dust amounts, and the same as mentioned above occurs again, there will be ~100e58 shares minted for ~100e18 liquidity.
5. Now if anyone attempts to withdraw any reasonable amount, it will revert due to the following: 
```solidity
    function convertToAssetsAndSync(uint256 shares) public returns (uint256 assets) {
        // Cache totalSupply.
        uint256 supply = totalSupply;

        assets = supply == 0 ? shares : shares.mulDivDown(totalAssetsAndSync() + VAS, supply + VAS);
    }
```
Note: shares is scaled at ~1e60 and assets are ~1e18. uint256 max value is ~1e77.

The assets deposited are then impossible to be withdrawn. The tranche will keep on accruing liquidity/fees and all of them will be permanently lost. 

This is a simple example when the used token has reasonable value + bad debt occurs only twice. If a certain tranche occurs bad debt often, this scenario becomes even more likely. And even more likely when the asset used has low value (e.g. <$1 per token)


## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to prevent deposits in the tranche if it has a non-zero dust amount in it (e.g. for 18 decimals token, under 1e10)
