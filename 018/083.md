# M-1 Lack of Asset Balance Check in auctionRepay Function in the LendingPool contract.

## Summary
The absence of a crucial asset balance check in they [ auctionRepay ](https://github.com/arcadia-finance/lending-v2/blob/main/src/LendingPool.sol#L489) function of the [LendingPool](https://github.com/arcadia-finance/lending-v2/blob/main/src/LendingPool.sol) contract poses a significant risk of unauthorized transfers.This oversight may disrupt the operational flow of the pool by allowing transfers to occur even when the initiating address lacks sufficient asset balance, potentially leading to failed transactions and operational inefficiencies
## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of a balance check in the [ auctionRepay ](https://github.com/arcadia-finance/lending-v2/blob/main/src/LendingPool.sol#L489) function allows asset transfers to proceed regardless of whether the initiating address has sufficient assets. This vulnerability exposes the platform to unauthorized transactions, compromising security and posing financial risks to users.
## Impact

The absence of a balance check in the  [ auctionRepay ](https://github.com/arcadia-finance/lending-v2/blob/main/src/LendingPool.sol#L489) function exposes the platform to various attack vectors, such as front-running, Sybil attacks, contract logic exploitation, and internal collusion. These vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized transfers, fund depletion, financial losses, and operational disruptions. Urgent implementation of security measures is necessary to mitigate these risks and ensure platform integrity.

## Code Snippet
 [ auctionRepay Function() ](https://github.com/arcadia-finance/lending-v2/blob/main/src/LendingPool.sol#L489)
```javascript
 function auctionRepay(uint256 startDebt, uint256 minimumMargin_, uint256 amount, address account, address bidder)
        external
        whenLiquidationNotPaused
        onlyLiquidator
        processInterests
        returns (bool earlyTerminate)
    {
        // Need to transfer before burning debt or ERC777s could reenter.
        // Address(this) is trusted -> no risk on re-entrancy attack after transfer.
        asset.safeTransferFrom(bidder, address(this), amount);

        uint256 accountDebt = maxWithdraw(account);
        if (accountDebt == 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.IsNotAnAccountWithDebt();
        if (accountDebt <= amount) {
            // The amount recovered by selling assets during the auction is bigger than the total debt of the Account.
            // -> Terminate the auction and make the surplus available to the Account-Owner.
            earlyTerminate = true;
            unchecked {
                _settleLiquidationHappyFlow(account, startDebt, minimumMargin_, bidder, (amount - accountDebt));
            }
            amount = accountDebt;
        }

        _withdraw(amount, address(this), account);

        emit Repay(account, bidder, amount);
    }
