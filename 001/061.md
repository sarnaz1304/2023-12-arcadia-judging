# new reward balances in AbstractStakingAM.sol are not calculated correctly

## Summary
in the functions (`mint()`, `increasingLiquidity()`, `decreaseLiquidity()`) `_getRewardBalances()` calculates the old reward values when a new amount should be calculated, when should the new value be calculated

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
// Calculate the new reward balances.
(assetState_, positionState_) = _getRewardBalances(assetState_, positionState_);

// Calculate the new staked amounts.
assetState_.totalStaked = assetState_.totalStaked + amount;
positionState_.amountStaked = positionState_.amountStaked + amount;
```
The comment indicates that we are calculating new reward balances, but the calculation of reward balances is based on old states
 before the `_totalStaked`, `_amountStaked` values are updated. 
Because of this, during the mint, increase, decrease of the position, the reward balances remain old, which leads to a loss of funds
 
## Impact
The calculation of the new reward balances is based on old states
before the `_totalStaked`, `_amountStaked` values are updated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

calculate new `_getRewardBalances` after updating the states
