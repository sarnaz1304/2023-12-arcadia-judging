# There's a discrepancy between how the external stargate staking contract and AbstractStakingAM calculates `pending rewards` and  `lastRewardPosition`

## Summary
They both use different formulars.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue with this discrepancy is that the amount of STG's(reward tokens), AbstractStakingAM.sol  contract receives on a user's  mint(), increaseLiquidity(), decreaseLiquidity() and claimReward() will defer from the amount of STG's(reward tokens) sent to the users when they decreaseLiquidity() or claimReward(). which isn't right.

This is due to the different formulars via which `pending rewards` i.e _STG's(reward tokens), which AbstractStakingAM.sol  contract receives on a user's  mint(), increaseLiquidity(), decreaseLiquidity() and claimReward()_   AND `lastRewardPosition` which is _The unclaimed amount of reward tokens of the position owner, at the last interaction of the owner with the AbstractStakingAM contract._ are gotten.

`pending rewards`  is calculated [this](https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate/blob/c647a3a647fc693c38b16ef023c54e518b46e206/contracts/LPStaking.sol#L28) way on the external stargate staking contract:  `pending reward = (user.amount * pool.accStargatePerShare) - user.rewardDebt` while ,

`lastRewardPosition` is calculated  in _getRewardBalances() this way: 
```solidity
 if (assetState_.totalStaked > 0) {
            // Calculate the new assetState
            // Fetch the current reward balance from the staking contract.
            uint256 currentRewardGlobal = _getCurrentReward(positionState_.asset);
            // Calculate the increase in rewards since last Asset interaction.
            uint256 deltaReward = currentRewardGlobal - assetState_.lastRewardGlobal;
            uint256 deltaRewardPerToken = deltaReward.mulDivDown(1e18, assetState_.totalStaked);
            // Calculate and update the new RewardPerToken of the asset.
            // unchecked: RewardPerToken can overflow, what matters is the delta in RewardPerToken between two interactions.
            unchecked {
                assetState_.lastRewardPerTokenGlobal =
                    assetState_.lastRewardPerTokenGlobal + SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(deltaRewardPerToken);
            }
            // Update the reward balance of the asset.
            assetState_.lastRewardGlobal = SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(currentRewardGlobal);

            // Calculate the new positionState.
            // Calculate the difference in rewardPerToken since the last position interaction.
            // unchecked: RewardPerToken can underflow, what matters is the delta in RewardPerToken between two interactions.
            unchecked {
                deltaRewardPerToken = assetState_.lastRewardPerTokenGlobal - positionState_.lastRewardPerTokenPosition;
            }
            // Calculate the rewards earned by the position since its last interaction.
            // unchecked: deltaRewardPerToken and positionState_.amountStaked are smaller than type(uint128).max.
            unchecked {
                deltaReward = deltaRewardPerToken * positionState_.amountStaked / 1e18;
            }
            // Update the reward balance of the position.
            positionState_.lastRewardPosition =
                SafeCastLib.safeCastTo128(positionState_.lastRewardPosition + deltaReward);
        }
```

This discrepancy opens up 2 bad scenarios:
1. users are underpayed their due STG's : Users should be given the exact STG's awarded to AbstractStakingAM.sol  contract  by the external stargate staking contract for their interactions.  This won't be fair.

2. There could be a scenario where the AbstractStakingAM.sol contract could run out of STGs due to overpaying the Users, this is  due to `lastRewardPosition` that is sent to the users from AbstractStakingAM STG's bal being larger than the `pending rewards` (i.e STGs) the AbstractStakingAM.sol contract received for the user's interactions.


The worst of the 2 above scenarios is the 2nd one... where the STG balance of the AbstractStakingAM contract could run out of STGs and not be able to settle the rewards of every user... due to users getting overpayed  more than what the AbstractStakingAM receives for their interactions with the external Stargate staking contract
## Impact
Users could be underpayed the STG's due to them  which isn't fair 

or

 users could be overpaid making AbstractStakingAM.sol contract run out of STGs and it won't be able to settle every user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make  the calculation for `lastRewardPosition` mirror how `pending rewards` was calculated in the  external stargate staking contract so as to reduce this discrepancy and reduce the risk of the above mentioned impacts
