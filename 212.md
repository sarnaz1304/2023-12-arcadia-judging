# Incomplete flashAction by Creditor Manager due to missing Implementation

## Summary
Incomplete flashAction by Creditor Manager due to missing Implementation in the flashAction (...) functiom of the AccountV1 contract
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function flashActionByCreditor(address actionTarget, bytes calldata actionData)
        external
        nonReentrant
        notDuringAuction
        updateActionTimestamp
 >>>       returns (uint256 accountVersion)
    {
... 
accountVersion = ACCOUNT_VERSION;
}
```
The function above shows how flash action is a handled by the creditor through the flashActionByCreditor (...) Function, the problem is that when the manager is to handle this flash action, account version is not put into consideration even though it is a necessity and is required for adequate consistency in the AccountV1 contract
```solidity
function flashAction(address actionTarget, bytes calldata actionData)
        external
        onlyAssetManager
        nonReentrant
        notDuringAuction
        updateActionTimestamp
    {
... 
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Arcadia Protocol should make necessary adjust ment in the flashAction(...) Functiom to ensure account version is also updated where necessary when this function is called to ensure consistency in Arcadia Protocol
