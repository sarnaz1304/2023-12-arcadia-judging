# AbstractStakingAM allows owner of nft to withdraw balance before selling nft

## Summary
AbstractStakingAM allows owner of nft to withdraw balance before selling nft. This is because there is no any restrictions that exist inside vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user locks LP tokens in the AbstractStakingAM, then [erc721 token is created for him](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/main/accounts-v2/src/asset-modules/abstracts/AbstractStakingAM.sol#L317). Later user can do whatever he wants with this erc721 token. So it's possible that such tokens will be traded on markets.

`AbstractStakingAM.decreaseLiquidity` function decreases position balance for the nft. Currently there is no guarantee for the purchaser, that he will receive nft with LP amount that he wanted to buy as nft owner can decrease almost whole position right before order will be filled in the nft marketplace.
## Impact
Nft purchaser can get less amount of LP.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Inside `Vault` contract you have already implemented protection with `lastActionTimestamp` variable. You can reuse it here as well. Or you can allow to use `StakingAM.mint` to put token as collateral only. In this case function should send token to the vault after creation and when withdraw from vault it should unstake fully.
