# Dutch auction buys can be griefed resulting in Bad Debt accrual for the protocol


## Summary
Bid function in Liquidator.sol takes in askedAssetAmount[] but if even one of the asked assets is 1 wei less in the account the entire txn reverts.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function bid(address account, uint256[] memory askedAssetAmounts, bool endAuction_) external nonReentrant {....}
```
The bid function's asked assetAmounts are directly passed to \_withdrawERC20 which reverts if there is not enough recorded balance.

```solidity
    function _withdrawERC20(address to, address ERC20Address, uint256 amount) internal {
        erc20Balances[ERC20Address] -= amount;
		....
    }
```

Malicious user can use this to make protocol accrue bad Debt

Scenario-
Account A has 1000e6 usdc, bob thinks that it is right price to buy in dutch auction, he tries to buy all the usdc, but alice frontruns and buys just 1 , which will cause bob's txns to revert.

This can lead to bot wars, where one bot griefs another until they buy collateral at a significantly lower price.
 

## Impact

Loss to the protocol

## Recommendation

Propogate to users that if they want to buy the entire collateral they need to pass in uint256.max in askedAssetAmounts.

If asked askedAssetAmounts are uint256.max let the user buy all the recorded balances.
