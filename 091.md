# Bad debt can occur unexpectedly when liquidation is paused.

## Summary
When the `liquidation` process is paused, there may be some `accounts` for which `liquidation` has already started.
However, since no one can bid during the pause period, the auction may not be completed within the `cutoff` time.
## Vulnerability Detail
- `Liquidation` for some `accounts` has been initiated.
  It is possible because the `liquidation` is not paused at this time.
```solidity
 function startLiquidation(address initiator, uint256 minimumMargin_)
  external
  override
  whenLiquidationNotPaused   // @audit, 
  processInterests
  returns (uint256 startDebt) {}
```
- The `guardian` has paused the `liquidation`.
```solidity
function pause() external override onlyGuardian afterCoolDownOf(32 days) {
    pauseTimestamp = uint96(block.timestamp);

    emit PauseFlagsUpdated(
        repayPaused = true,
        withdrawPaused = true,
        borrowPaused = true,
        depositPaused = true,
        liquidationPaused = true // @audit
    );
}
```
- `Bidding` is not permitted because the `liquidation` has been paused.
```solidity
function auctionRepay(uint256 startDebt, uint256 minimumMargin_, uint256 amount, address account, address bidder)
  external
  whenLiquidationNotPaused  // @audit
  onlyLiquidator
  processInterests
  returns (bool earlyTerminate) {}
```
- When the `liquidation` is `unpaused`, anyone can end the `auction` and the `cutoff` time has already passed, manual `liquidation` should occur.
```solidity
function endAuction(address account) external nonReentrant {
   if (!_settleAuction(account, auctionInformation_)) revert LiquidatorErrors.EndAuctionFailed();
   _endAuction(account);
}
function _settleAuction(address account, AuctionInformation storage auctionInformation_) {
    } else if (block.timestamp > auctionInformation_.cutoffTimeStamp) {
        // Unhappy flow: Auction did not end within the cutoffTime.
        ILendingPool(creditor).settleLiquidationUnhappyFlow(account, startDebt, minimumMargin, msg.sender);
        // All remaining assets are transferred to the asset recipient,
        // and a manual (trusted) liquidation has to be done.
        IAccount(account).auctionBoughtIn(creditorToAccountRecipient[creditor]);
    } 
}
```

Clearly, we should minimize the occurrence of manual `liquidation`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow `bidding` for `accounts` for which `liquidation` has already started.
```solidity
function auctionRepay(uint256 startDebt, uint256 minimumMargin_, uint256 amount, address account, address bidder)
    external
-    whenLiquidationNotPaused
    onlyLiquidator
    processInterests
    returns (bool earlyTerminate) {}
```
```solidity
function settleLiquidationHappyFlow(address account, uint256 startDebt, uint256 minimumMargin_, address terminator)
    external
-     whenLiquidationNotPaused
    onlyLiquidator
    processInterests {}
```
Since new `liquidations` won't occur while the `liquidation` is paused, there shouldn't be any issue.
