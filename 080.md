# Borrower may immediately liquidated after repayments resume

## Summary
If there is a pause in repayments, market fluctuations during that pause may cause a borrower to become subject to liquidation because the borrower is unable to repay ().

## Vulnerability Detail
This situation unfairly disadvantages borrowers, as such borrowers are subject to liquidation through no fault of their own. When repayments resume, a borrower is immediately liquidated, unfairly disadvantaging the borrower and giving a huge advantage to the liquidator.

## Impact

Borrowers may lose their funds during a pause when the market begins to move, as a result of which liquidators begin the liquidation process.

## Recommendation

 there should be a grace period during which borrowers can't be liquidated: grace period == the period that repayments were paused
