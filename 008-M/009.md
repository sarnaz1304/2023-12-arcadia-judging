# Wrong intergation with Stargate's LPStakingTime contract leads to all users earn less interest than expected and rewards got stuck in StakedStargateAM contract

## Summary
Wrong intergation with Stargate's LPStakingTime contract leads to all users earn less interest than expected and rewards got stuck in StakedStargateAM contract
## Vulnerability Detail
Stagate's LPStakingTime have no method to specialise to only withdrawing reward out. Due to that, LPStakingTime.deposit() and LPStakingTime.withdraw() beside depositing/withdraw funds, it will also send the accumulated reward to the caller.

In StakedStargateAM, we don't have any logic to store the value of received reward during a call deposit() and withdraw(), hence the protocol is not even know that the reward is already distribute

## Impact
This will lead to user who owns StakedStargateAM NFT will lose majority of reward. And the StakedStargateAM contract have the no method to take the un distribute reward out

```diff
+   uint256 cache;
    
    function _stake(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
+	cache += LP_STAKING_TIME.pendingEmissionToken(assetToPid[asset], address(this));
        ERC20(asset).approve(address(LP_STAKING_TIME), amount);

        LP_STAKING_TIME.deposit(assetToPid[asset], amount);
    }

    function _withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
+	cache += LP_STAKING_TIME.pendingEmissionToken(assetToPid[asset], address(this));
        LP_STAKING_TIME.withdraw(assetToPid[asset], amount);
    }

    function _claimReward(address asset) internal override {
+	cache = 0;
        LP_STAKING_TIME.withdraw(assetToPid[asset], 0);
    }

    function _getCurrentReward(address asset) internal view override returns (uint256 currentReward) {
-       currentReward = LP_STAKING_TIME.pendingEmissionToken(assetToPid[asset], address(this));
+       currentReward = LP_STAKING_TIME.pendingEmissionToken(assetToPid[asset], address(this)) + cache;
    }
