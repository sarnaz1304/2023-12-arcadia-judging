# Account owner can make account healthy between liquidation start and auction bid, resulting in bidder getting rewarded.

## Summary
If an account who's liquidation has already started, account owner tries to repay partial amount to and make the account healthy. 
Debt is now reduced but liquidator still goes through with the bid and gets rewarded for making acccount healthy. 
## Vulnerability Detail
An account goes into liquidation when [`liquidateAccount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/de7289bebb3729505a2462aa044b3960d8926d78/lending-v2/src/Liquidator.sol#L199)  is called. However account owner can still call repay and make the account healthy during this period. 
But a bidder can go ahead with the [`bid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/de7289bebb3729505a2462aa044b3960d8926d78/lending-v2/src/Liquidator.sol#L285) function with minimal `askedAssetAmounts` and still get rewarded for settling the liquidation in happy flow, [`_settleLiquidationHappyFlow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-12-arcadia/blob/de7289bebb3729505a2462aa044b3960d8926d78/lending-v2/src/LendingPool.sol#L505). 
Also this additional fees and penalty to the accouns debt as a result since the bid went through.
 

## Impact
Bidder gets rewards he does not deserve and account owner gets added additional rewards/penalties into their debt

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either do not allow account owner to repay once the liquidation has started or check for account health during bidding to revert the auction.
