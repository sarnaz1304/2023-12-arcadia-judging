# Users can lose funds as gas fees to bid when the liquidatable account repays its debt

## Summary
Anyone can `repay debt` when the `account` is under `auction`. 
So, if the `account`'s `debt` becomes `0`, the transaction to `bid` on this `account` will be reverted, and users who attempt to `bid` can lose their funds without any result.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Account A` can become `liquidatable`, and someone triggered the `liquidation` of this `account`.
```solidity
function liquidateAccount(address account) external nonReentrant {
    if (auctionInformation_.inAuction) revert LiquidatorErrors.AuctionOngoing();
    auctionInformation_.inAuction = true;
}
```
Someone repays this `account`'s `debt`.
This is possible even though this `account` is currently in `auction`.
```solidity
function repay(uint256 amount, address account) external whenRepayNotPaused processInterests {
    uint256 accountDebt = maxWithdraw(account);
    amount = accountDebt > amount ? amount : accountDebt;
    asset.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    _withdraw(amount, address(this), account);
    emit Repay(account, msg.sender, amount);
}
```
Anyone can still make a `bid` on this `account` because the `auction` has not ended.
```solidity
function bid(address account, uint256[] memory askedAssetAmounts, bool endAuction_) external nonReentrant {
    AuctionInformation storage auctionInformation_ = auctionInformation[account];
    if (!auctionInformation_.inAuction) revert LiquidatorErrors.NotForSale();  // @audit, will pass

    bool earlyTerminate = ILendingPool(auctionInformation_.creditor).auctionRepay(
        startDebt, auctionInformation_.minimumMargin, price, account, msg.sender
    );
}
```
And this will be reverted because the `debt` of this `account` has already been repaid.
```solidity
function auctionRepay(uint256 startDebt, uint256 minimumMargin_, uint256 amount, address account, address bidder) {
    asset.safeTransferFrom(bidder, address(this), amount);

    uint256 accountDebt = maxWithdraw(account);
    if (accountDebt == 0) revert LendingPoolErrors.IsNotAnAccountWithDebt();  // @audit, here
}
```


## Impact
As a result, until someone ends this `auction`, users who want to buy the `collateral tokens` from this `account` can lose funds as gas fees and get nothing.

## Recommendation
Prevent `repayment` to the `account` if the `account` is in the `auction`.
