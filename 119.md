# withdraw from Stargate will revert

## Summary
The withdrawal function will be revert due to the check in updatePool

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is the double call of `LPStakingTime.withdraw()` from `AbstractStakingAM.decreaseLiquidity()'. `AbstractStakingAM.decreaseLiquidity()` calls first `_withdraw()` then `_claimReward()`.

```solidity
    function _claimReward(address asset) internal override {
        LP_STAKING_TIME.withdraw(assetToPid[asset], 0);
    }
```
```solidity
    function _withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount) internal override {
        // Withdraw asset
        LP_STAKING_TIME.withdraw(assetToPid[asset], amount);
    }
```
After the first call from the `_withdraw()` function, the second call from `_claimReward()` will not pass due to the check in the `updatePool()` function located in `LPStakingTime.withdraw()`.
```solidity
  function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (block.timestamp <= pool.lastRewardTime) {
            return;
}
...}
```
`_claimReward()` will revert

## Impact 
`AbstractStakingAM.decreaseLiquidity()` calls the `LPStakingTime.withdraw()` function twice.  During the second call, the withdraw function will be returned due to the check in `updatePool`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove `_claimReward` from `decreaseLiquidity()`:

1) in `AbstractStakingAM.sol` there is a  ```claimReward()``` function
2) when calling the `_withdraw()` function, rewards are also collected
