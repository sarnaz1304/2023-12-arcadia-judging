# Chainlink aggregators return the incorrect price if it drops below minAnswer

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators return the incorrect price if it drops below minAnswer

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink aggregators are equipped with a built-in circuit breaker to manage situations where the price of an asset moves outside of a predetermined price range. In the event of a significant decrease in an asset's value, such as the case with the LUNA crash, the oracle will continue to return the minAnswer instead of the actual price of the asset. This mechanism, detailed in [Chainlink's documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits), includes minAnswer and maxAnswer circuit breakers to mitigate potential issues when the asset's price falls below the minAnswer. 

## Impact
This issue could potentially allow users to exploit certain parts of the protocol, leading to significant issues and potential loss of funds, which is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Recommendation
 Implement a validation check to revert if the price received from the oracle is beyond the predefined bounds.
