# Mismatched Return Types in maxDeposit && maxMint in Tranche.sol

## Summary

Both maxDeposit and maxMint functions in the provided code snippet declare their return values as uint256 but have a guaranteed maximum result limited by type(uint128).max. This discrepancy can lead to type mismatch errors, inefficient gas usage, and potential confusion.


## Vulnerability Detail
The functions maxDeposit and maxMint have the following issues:

### Declared Return Type Mismatch
- The return type is declared as uint256 which can hold values up to 2^256. However, the actual calculation uses type(uint128).max as the upper limit, which is approximately 2^128. This mismatch can cause issues with dependent code expecting a full uint256 value.

### Inefficient Gas Usage: 
- Using a larger data type than necessary consumes more gas for storage and manipulation, potentially increasing transaction costs.

```solidity
    function maxDeposit(address) public view override returns (uint256 maxAssets) {
....
        maxAssets = type(uint128).max - LENDING_POOL.totalLiquidity();
    }


    function maxMint(address) public view override returns (uint256 maxShares) {
...
        maxShares = convertToShares(type(uint128).max - LENDING_POOL.totalLiquidity());
    }

```
While this doesn't directly introduce a security vulnerability, it can create issues and inefficiencies in the code.

## Impact
- Provide clarity on the actual range of return values.
- Potential type mismatch errors in dependent code.
- Increased gas consumption due to unnecessary data size.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the return types of maxDeposit and maxMint to uint128 to accurately reflect the maximum possible result.
```solidity
function maxDeposit(address) public view override returns (uint128 maxAssets) {
    // ... calculations ...
    maxAssets = type(uint128).max - LENDING_POOL.totalLiquidity();
}

function maxMint(address) public view override returns (uint128 maxShares) {
    // ... calculations ...
    maxShares = convertToShares(type(uint128).max - LENDING_POOL.totalLiquidity());
}

```
